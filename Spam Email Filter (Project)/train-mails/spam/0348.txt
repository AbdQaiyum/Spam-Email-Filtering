my name is jeremy lessaris im looking for investment properties in the midwest the issue ive been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties im looking for you know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell maybe theyre really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood but for what ever reason the houses just dont sell

i need those houses

most of the agents ive dealt with were hesitant because there isnt much of a return for what time and effort you invest however the private investors i work with use unconventional private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals in fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week i am prequalified with greentree funding for up to  for a purchase money mortgage based on a nonowner occupied loan at  ltv  and of course you get your full commission 

im not a licensed real estate agent nor am i affiliated with any real estate firm which means i can work with you just about any way you want please dont be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested sometimes i can even pay retail price the only guarantee ill make is that i will not waste your time and in most cases i can tell you over the phone whether im interested or not 

if you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  synteligent properties please contact me   or email me  jeremysynteligentcom 

best wishes 
jeremy lessaris
