   exmh has a funky cutpaste model that is essentially all my fault
   the middle click sets the insert point  if you hate that go to the
   bindings simple edit preferences window and deselect
   paste sets insert  

unfortunately the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer
possible to cutpaste within one sedit window some intermediate client
always must be used except in the rare case where you want to select
some text and then paste it at the same place

thats because the click that you have to with this option make to set
the insert point also kills the selection it ends up reverting to the
last selection made in some other window or something like that

so the vast majority of people probably want that paste sets insert
enabled  that one you can learn to live with the other is much more
painful
