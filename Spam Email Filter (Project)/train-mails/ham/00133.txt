i managed to get myself an imac yesterday just a g but a goodun and was
wondering if any of the apple people on here could recommend a good isp for
narrow band at the moment for getting online under os x

stew

my local isp works great with my imac i dont know what you guys 
have over there but os x ought to let you get online as well as 
anything else

crossing my fingers thoughi did a upgrade to jaguar and ended up 
doing a scrape and install after that 

oh and i am on k dialup
