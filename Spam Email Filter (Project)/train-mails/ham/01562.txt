 i found a nice little perl script for this purpose called rotate which 
 makes the process of rotating log files very simple  if theres an 
 official source for this script i couldnt find it  my hosting 
 provider paircom has it installed and thats where i found it 
  however redistribution appears to be allowed so ive attached it

thanks for the script  it also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems or at least redhat systems will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
homerazorrazoragentlog can be specified
