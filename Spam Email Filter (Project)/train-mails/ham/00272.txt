 is there any reliable way to calculate your connection speed if you dont
 trust what the modem reports

do a wget of a file of known length in a script that runs date before
and after or equivalent

be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing
speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
quite another  remember that hardwarelevel compression is a factor
the file you wget will probably be precompressed

in the area of the slightly more exotic be aware that different traffic
may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
points in the transit tofrom you  and that some traffic may go via 
different paths coming vs going

be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
matters  depending on what youre doing the modems connection latency
might matter and this differs widely between modems  it matters more
for interactive sessions eg ssh remote logins where each keystroke
is echoed from remote
