   so ill probably poke around at the sequences performance issues

well theres this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand 

     hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that dont exist
    foreach m rseq 
        if file exists mhprofilepathfolderm 
            exmhdebug mhprofilepathfolderm not found
            set ix lsearch seq m
            set seq lreplace seq ix ix
         else 
             real hack
            break
        
    

which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that dont exist   im not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any
of the others but im sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots
and i dont know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at all the time

it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory   does tcl have a directory read function   i assume so

mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the
context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called

   ill email anything i figure out since im leaving town in less 
   than  hours

have a good vacation
