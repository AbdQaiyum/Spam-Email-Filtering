washington apthe military command responsible for the defense of north
american airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports
of an airborne condensation trail or contrail moving from the caribbean to
the united states defense officials said thursday 

lt col michael humm a pentagon spokesman said the incident happened
wednesday and that the north american aerospace defense command in colorado
springs colo was continuing to investigate 

the reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it
could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or
approaching american airspace in the aftermath of the sept  attacks the
pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor us airspace 

a contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold
air 

the jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source
of the contrail found nothing said lt cmdr curtis jenkins a norad
spokesman he said norad had developed no new information since the initial
report at  pm est on wednesday norad is reviewing data from its tracking
radars in search of evidence he said 

a pentagon statement said norad received unverified reports of what
appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin originally in the vicinity of
the turks and caicos islands in the caribbean 

initially it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the united
states the statement said commercial airline pilots later reported the
contrail over florida and later over indiana thereafter no other sightings
were reported 

the reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact the
pentagon statement said 

at the federal aviation administration spokesman paul turk said im
aware of the reports he referred all questions to norad 

jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the
caribbean he also was unsure who requested norad to launch fighter jets or
from which military bases they were scrambled 

we dont necessarily judge or secondguess when a request comes to us to
investigate a contrail he said 

meanwhile reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early thursday
had people throughout the northwest flooding radio and television stations
with calls reporting a meteor shower 

it was believed that the light came from a russian rocket body reentering
the earths atmosphere about  am the us strategic command in omaha
neb and the north american aerospace defense command confirmed a russian
rocket fell back to earth but gave no further details
