thanks for the great work mathias but i would like to point out that this
list is fastly become the aptrpmlist instead of the rpmlist the
discussion concerning apt is overwhelming maybe another list is in order
for those having trouble with aptrpm aptrpmhotlinefreshrpmsnet  

though i think aptrpm is a great tool i dont use it and would like to
get back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques
