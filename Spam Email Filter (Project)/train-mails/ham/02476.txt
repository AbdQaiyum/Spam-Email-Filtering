geege wrote a strange story
i know a guy who in attempting to loosen  a nut at the base of the toilet 
tapped it with a wrench cracked the bowl in half and to prevent a flood 
held the bowl together with his knees until his wife returned from work 
quite some time later

the bowl doesnt hold that much water i
would have let it spill and then cleaned
it up even the tank only holds a gallon
if new or three if old
