the following was personal correspondence between two people  i cant
fathom how razor thinks it is spam


 we are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to
 go ahead with our plans to purchase an ocr and forms
 scanning solution

 an outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to
 long ago you folks were considering implementing ocr
 technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency
 if you could let us know if you did move foreward with any
 plans in that direction it would be of great help to us may i ask
 what initialy prompted you to consider ocr did you decide it
 could help your compamy what software did you go with
 would you recomend we take a look at it
 at present we are still planning to continue our research until
 we decide which ocr system best suits our needs then
 implement it quickly

 if you are just starting to consider this
 technology feel free to stay in touch we will let you know what
 we decide on and if it works for us

 if you cannot advise on this please forward this email to the
 proper individual in your company who might be able to help with
 this
 thanks
 jay
