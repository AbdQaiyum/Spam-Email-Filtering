hello bill

monday september    pm you wrote


 mf i dont think free speech is a license to speak directly at
 and be in the
 mf physical presence of any particular individual of your
 choosing  especially
 mf when that individual is busy doing something else and isnt
 interested

bs yep i agree 


 sure  and that goes back to my second argument  cohen   they can
 walk away   nobody compells them to stand there ill agree fully
 but we still have a constitutional right to speak out against
 policies actions and grievances

 again  if you want it another way lets change the constitution

bs huh  are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard
bs shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship if
bs shouting down public speakers is protected it is only a matter of time
bs before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
bs them every single time they open their mouth the tactic is stupid and
bs nonproductive and if generally used will only result in chaos  the tactic
bs is just stupid egobation at best unless the goal is to generate chaos
bs and humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
bs should be locked up provided you can accurately identify them which is not
bs really possible anyway but hey this is my rant  imho

bs bill


no offense or anything but theres a difference between holding a
sign that doesnt agree with bush and screaming at him

my sole point as far as the st amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry liberal youth  which is the
gross culmination of everyones argument sofar  the screaming isnt
the most effective method around  i dont believe i argued that it
was  but screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned   for the record i dont
support the screamers in organized conferences such as the colin
powell shoutdown that was mentioned earlier  i dont think that
this is what the st amendment was implying  these folks do have a
right to be heard and i think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place

my point my only point was really more concerned with the cases
such as mr nell   he wasnt engaged at least from the limited facts
we have in a shoutout but rather in a difference of opinion   he
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected   a sign is not a shoutout

i think i may have missed or not accurately addressed the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix  i was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broadbrush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it   in this case the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with   theyre resorting to creative
offensive and constitutionally challengable means but its not simply
due to the fact that theyre  and have lost all decorum   the my
generation never did this  is all bs   theres more to this story
we just dont know it all

i hope this clarifies my position   for the quick rehash

screaming  free speech on all cases
dissent  free speech provided you follow what has been laid down by
the supremes

k

 
best regards
