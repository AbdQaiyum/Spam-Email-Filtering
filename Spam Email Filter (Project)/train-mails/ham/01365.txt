here are the new scores in the  branch they may change but they
are better than before

score invalidmsgid                  
score msgidaddedbymta            
score msgidaddedbymta          

total of  which is better than  i suppose

if they fixed their msgid it would help  i suppose we could allow
comments without hurting spam detection too much but im reluctant
its pretty bizarre to put a comment after the messageid header

can you open a bugzilla ticket for this one
