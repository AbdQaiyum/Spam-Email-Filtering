  so ive attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
  targetkernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you
  still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed but at
  least it doesnt have to be currently running its kinda hackish so
  if someone has a better way to do this let me know
 
 that idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more what
 you sent doesnt support packages named kernelsmp id also prefer a
 cleaner way than the env variable and preferrably not editing the spec
 probably define target xxxx with smp sound good enough
 the buildrequires on kernelsource will also need to be removed because
 it wont necessarily need to be true and that does bug me a bit 

the define is exactly what i was looking for i was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm like the
with switches but for some reason didnt think of using
define my computer is currently gone for repairs but once its
back ill rewrite the specfile add support for kernelsmp and email
it to the list for further criticism 

as far as requiring kernelsource i dont feel its a big problem if
youre gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms
its not a far stretch to package the source tree too as i currently
do

also ive found that the alsadriver source needs a usbrelated patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels prex are other 
people seeing the same thing or is this just a problem with my setup

gary

ps if i didnt mention it before thanks for the alsa packages they 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before
