   well ive used the checkthemodifytime cache trick for files in
   many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it
   is effective  however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
   state then arent we modifying the sequences file for the current
   folder on every message read  perhaps we look at the sequences file
   more than once per message view  
  
  as id written the code a few months ago we were reading the sequences
  file 
  first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence  this
  
  happens anywhere that we look at sequences most notably in
  ftocshowsequences
  that seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise but i wanted my
  abstraction to 
  have a separate call for what sequences are in this folder and what 
  messages are in this sequence  one option would have been to add
  another 
  call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the
  checkthemodifytime 
  technique would be less errorprone

i like the checkthemodifytime technique

  i think the biggest gains would be from augmenting ftocshowsequences to
  allow 
  a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that
  the 
  current code would only be run when we really do have to update all
  sequences 
  for all messages  i described these thoughts in an email message
  yesterday
  
  and again if it can wait a few weeks im willing to do it

ok  ive yet to dive into the latest round of changes but i plan to
i can say ill make any progress but i may dabble  thanks again for
all your work in this area  generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about  years
