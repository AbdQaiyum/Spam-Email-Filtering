im fairly confused here with procmail 
i know this isnt a procmail list perse feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to rgilmanhunthotpcom  

ive looked for webstuff to answer this question but i cant find anything 
specific on this scenario

heres the situation 
i have a global etcprocmailrc file it works and when i insert stuff into 
it for logging logfilerootprocmaillog verboseyeah logabstractall it 
shows up where i expect it to the log in rootprocmaillog  at the end of 
this file i use 
 fw
  spamc
to call spamassassin

also in it is a carboncopy recipe yes i know its one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters  at the top to their credit i am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability so they want a record made discussion 
on this point is immaterial

    test d archivedirdatedir  mkdir p mode archivedirdatedir
   
 c
 saveat

i have several users where i forward certain spams to devnull    their 
procmailrc file homeuserprocmailrc looks like this

   from spermfuncom
  devnull

now ive got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address outside the company so ive got this recipe in her 
homeuserprocmailrc file
 c
  userdomaintld

it almost looks like procmails not running a users copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe except that i can replace that users one with 
 
  subject test
  procmailholder
and get the same result

the result to put it succinctly is nothing no forwards go out no files 
are made if i try to log information no logs are set up ive modified the 
usergroup and permissions to match knownworking recipes the spermfun 
example above and still nothing  however i can redirect those other 
messages  in other words just this users procmailrc file is not working 
other users have no problems

any suggestions would be helpful
