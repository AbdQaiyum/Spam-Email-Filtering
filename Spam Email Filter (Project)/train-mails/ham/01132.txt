 the speed is a problem for sure  it takes a long time to do the
 rescanning of sequences i associate it with hitting the flist
 button or when my background flist goes off    im running on a
 pretty fast system athlon  mb ram k rpm ultra scsi disk
 and hitting flist used to take no more than a second  the big
 difference might just be perception because the the old code just
 updated all the folders count  color all at once instead of making
 it look like there is  unseen then counting its way back up  
 
 i doubt ill have much time in the immediate future to hack at this
 but if i do  can you suggest areas that might be the best to
 optimize   if not do you think we can put in some preferences to
 disable some of the more intensive features   id rather disable all
 the sequence support except unseen of course and have reasonable
 speed   i suspect people on slow machines would find the current
 state unusable

if i knew where the problem was id fix it myself

finding it is probably more work than the actual fix

  
  this is because of your hookmsgshowupdateunseen which is calling a fun
 ctio
  n 
  which no longer exists
  
  i suspect you need
  	seqdel exmhfolder unseen msgid
  now instead of 
  	mhmarkseen exmhfolder msgid
  
 
 thanks  im not sure ill need it with the new sequence code but i
 might  does your new code commit sequences immediately  the old code
 didnt so i put that in to help keep my mh and exmh windows in sync

yes it does
