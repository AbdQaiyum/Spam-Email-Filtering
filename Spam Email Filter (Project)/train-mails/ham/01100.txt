 i have a few such things with jdk imlib kernel dri version

 that is

hm one could do this with rpms justdb switch too without having to 
make a dummy package right

i was wondering that this is a bit dangerous if there is a update for my 
software as the dummy package might get updated with it overwriting the 
installation ive done from source not good

is there really no nodeps kind of switch in aptget
