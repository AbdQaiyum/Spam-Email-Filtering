subject re goodbye global warming


ive seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums
for several years  ive always found archaeology interesting for no
particular reason  here is a recent article from us news that i
actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository

defrosting the past

ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers a bounty
of a warming world

by alex markels

as he hiked near colorados continental divide in the summer of  ed
knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 
feet it looked like a bison skull the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls i thought thats strange bison dont
live this high up 

knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bisonone that died about  years ago this was an extraordinary
discovery says russ graham the museums chief curator adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago theres
probably a lot more like it yet to be found

and not just bison colorado isnt the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru
to alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the worlds  glaciers as
the ice recedes a treasuretrove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze the fabrics wood bone and dnarich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our
predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued

its mindboggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains says johan reinhard a highaltitude
archaeologist and explorerinresidence at the national geographic
society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the andes of peru in the s and the legendary yearold ice
man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in  have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as
the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains

vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother
natureand looterstake them first once uncovered frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover theyre
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
dont even realize theyre ancient

that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice
recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked
closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones

figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur
trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a ziploc
bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunters body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what
seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about  years ago dubbed kwaday dan tsinchi or long ago
person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who
may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the bestpreserved human
from the period ever found in north america

other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could
explain what that longago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we
see that this area was very much part of peoples seasonal activities

like wards discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband
gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at  feet in the mountains of the south
yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadnt been
caribou in the area for at least  years recalls kuzyk then a
wildlife biologist with the yukon government

caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a
yearold atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the
ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 
years of changing hunting practices

scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies
hunters followed the game they returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice weve got people hunting with throwing darts
up until  years ago says hare who now oversees the research
project then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
 years ago and by  years ago theres no more throwing
darts

now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck they
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaskas wrangell
and st elias mountain rangesthe united states most glaciated
terrainand in the andes johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing
european alps could also deliver more findings perhaps as exquisite as
the ice man global warming is providing us highaltitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now were
probably about the only ones happy about it
