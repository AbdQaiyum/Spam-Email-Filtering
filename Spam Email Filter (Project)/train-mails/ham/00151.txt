 as a workaround the various distributions could use a gpg singature to verify 
 correctness of the file  since the distributors secret key is required to 
 create that signature it would add a pretty significant step that would have 
 to be taken to make it possible to replace both a rpm or apt file and its 
 accompanying signature

check your local friendly red hat installation

rootlocalhost update rpm checksig zshsrcrpm
zshsrcrpm md gpg ok

of course this is only as useful as say the gpg keys distributed with 
the kernel tarballs ie if you dont actually bother checking the sig 
then you are open to abuse its entirely possible that rpm can be 
configured to require good signatures but ive not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet
