 devfd is stdin  filedescriptor   looks like the ps file wants
 to know its filename but its being read from stdin thats my
 guess  

i dont think so it should be getting a stream of ps from stdin
but its not the printingspooling system is executing gs but
somehow failing to provide it with input

 try tweaking the scripts to run gs with the ps file on
 the command line instead of as 

that might clarify that the later part of the system works but i
suspect the problem is earlier
