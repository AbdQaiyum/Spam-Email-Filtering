  are there perhaps licensing issues which forbid such a practice or any other
  reasons
  
  the reason i ask is that i have seen performance and also some feature

  comparing with or without the win codecs the mplayer authors seem to
  recommend using them for x architectures
  
  beware i am no mplayercodecswhatever expert i may be totally lost
