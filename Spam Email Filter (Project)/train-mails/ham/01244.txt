since i upgraded to redhat mplayer vo sdl isnt working for me
it gives me black screen and i only hear sound

can anyone help me with this 
    


ill test this as soon as i can

  

btw
also the source rpm specified that i can do without libdv
but it didnt work worked for lirc and arts
    


should be fixed  you probably had libdvdevel installed and mplayer
automatically detected it the new spec file explicitely passes
disablelibdv when the package is rebuilt with without libdv

grab the fr spec from here

the new spec didnt even want to build the package
something with configmak
also this new spec looks like the old one it got libdv and libdvdevel
in the buildrequires so i just used the normal spec and removed it manully
