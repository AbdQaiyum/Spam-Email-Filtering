at fermi yes im back there long story were buying u systems like 
the fiscal year is ending  we have  asa irus systems not pushing 
them there are some other similar units available with  more on 
order  theyre  tb for k although we add a separate ide or 
scsi system disk because the ware raid controllers can saturate 
intel sds motherboard  ghz ps  gb ram  ware  raid 
controllers  gb maxtors syskonnect gigabit enet fermi redhat

theres some interesting info at

httpmitfnalgovmsncdfcafserverevaluationhtml

weve decided to go with xfs which linus has just merged into the  
tree mostly because none of the other journaled fss can maintain  
gbs rates with a nearly full filesystem mostly gb files with random 
deletions we use these systems for caching our  petabyte tape store 
  ext almost did it but dropped from from mbs to  with random 
deletions and didnt want to do direct io at all  only concern is an 
occasional system lockup we havent chased down yet  a load avg   
is always a patio of fun

oddly even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up 
with the new stk b tape drives which crank along at a steady 
gbs  and you oldforktimers will remember doofus my old file server 
system  it would only take  of rackspace now instead of  racks

cheers
