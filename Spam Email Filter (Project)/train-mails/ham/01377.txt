  there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are
  planning on making money from the spam  what a court would consider
  evidence of being the spammer is another question

 haha

 just a few notes

   it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone
    in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a
    good example even if they do officially respect copyright law

sa and other filters could be configured to ignore the swe mark if it 
appears to come fromthrough china

   spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i
    dont understand it either but nobody said they were bright  also
    some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example
    pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly
    required for the spammer to get their way

sa could also be configured so that swe marks are ignored in messages that 
look like thirdparty spam like stock scams  of course this would still 
mean that the un is going to invade america spams with swe would get 
through  probably also need to ignore swe in messages that look like 
nigerian scams

 
give a man a match and hell be warm for a minute but set him on
fire and hell be warm for the rest of his life
