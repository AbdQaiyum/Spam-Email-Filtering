  thank you that was exactly what i needed
  dvd works great now
 
 btw i think ill kake it so that my ogle package automatically inserts
 this options idecd dma to etcmodulesconf it currently creates the
 devdvd link to devcdrom which will work most of the time if theres
 only one drive if no devdvd exists

eek  maybe its just me but i dont think thats a good idea 
outputting a message in post and providing a readme of some kind would
be better as well as perhaps adding a note in description
