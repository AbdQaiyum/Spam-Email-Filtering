joe gregorio my next pet project trying to recreate the good 
easy on a windows machine i have also made halfhearted attempts in 
this direction as i am forced to use windows during the day i say 
halfhearted because im still applicationcentric and i dont go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as i could but i dont use the desktop at all never have 
on any system and i dont use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because i 
personally find them awkward ymmv if you must use windows the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your start menu 

i use the main level of the start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs  control panel  mozilla  emacs  dos 
home  dos work  dos incoming each of which gives me a command line 
but in different directories  python  ie also  explorer home 
 explorer work  explorer incoming which open explorer windows in 
various useful directories the same directories as the dos shortcuts only 
with the shift key held down and yes i intentionally set it up so that  went 
to my work folder lessused programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
as installed and moved directly into the programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed adaware excel im netscape  
paint shop pro query tool odbc vmware word all other 
submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu yes delete 
accessories do you honestly ever use it if so its probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem things which never need to be run manually like 
winzip and quicktime are removed from the programs menu maintaining a clean 
programs menu is an ongoing struggle but well worth it 

on most modern keyboards there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu  gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape  for 
compatibility testing in my day job ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always 
open but i quit lesserused applications as soon as im done using them 
mostly because my laptop doesnt have a lot of memory 

i install cygwin so that the command line is actually useful cygwin is a 
collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities including mv 
cp scp ssh man tar less grep patch ncftp cvs and many others and 
bash which i dont use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
 x  almost full screen at  x  and screen buffer size to  x 
 set window position at  x  and dont let the system position the 
window 

in mozilla i set my home page to aboutblank set internet search to search 
with google use tabbed browsing open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases always show the tab bar and load links in the background essential for 
weblog surfing you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background under scripts  plugins i do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows i turn off the sidebar turn on the site navigation bar 
delete all preinstalled bookmarks and create two bookmarks one which takes 
me to my webmail and another which takes me to my internal site search 
from which i can find all other bookmarks i need 

in internet explorer i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog since 
thats the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between 
mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pguppgdown between tabs within mozilla 
since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible 

i use emacs locally and vi remotely because the default behavior of emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable for instance editing a cgi script named 
foocgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foocgi backup file which 
is worldreadable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this 
sometime on your favorite web site among other things my emacs file which 
is actually called emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory dbackup to treat all xml files as docbook all cgi 
scripts as python and all sql scripts as plsql to use cygwins bash shell 
for mxshell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar titled as the 
name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for 
yesno questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when 
i press mw i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepadexe to get 
all text files to open in emacs i got this idea from ultraedit my 
emacs file is my second most backedup possession 

i dont use windows useless directory structure for user home directories on 
my d drive i have dhome contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects each under cvs controlalso set as my home directory using the 
home environment variable dwork contains directories for each work 
project also under cvs dincoming set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things and dbackup used by emacs and for 
temporary storage for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created cvs projects i dont know or care whats where on my c drive 

i have tried many many address books and still store all my contacts email 
addresses snail mail addresses phone numbers and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone stored in dhomephone it is not in 
any particular format other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries i categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name and use mxoccur in emacs to search by keyword this file is 
my single most backedup possession 

other essential free windows utilities i use in no particular order tweakui
