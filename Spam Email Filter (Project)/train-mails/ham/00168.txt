 i seem to be having a little trouble with it my printersconf is

defaultprinter lp
info hp
location locals
deviceuri ipp
state idle
accepting yes
jobsheets none none
quotaperiod 
pagelimit 
klimit 
printer

 and cupds uses that to make a printcap of

lp

 sounds dodgy to me if someone has an example printersconfprintcap for
a jetdirect printer id appreciate it if they sent it on
