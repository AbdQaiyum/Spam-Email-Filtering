subject satalk  spamdspamc problem


i noticed that after upgrading to  or  from  the f
option was removed from spamd 

this is fine because all of the html format mail seems to arrive
properly however messages that get tagged as spam arrive as just html
source

is there any way around this i would like all htmlrtf messages to
retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam i would
accomplish this on  by using the f  flag when starting spamd

thanks

regards
