 hmmm again youre telling me that youve never had a nasty bug that took
 you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak  i am
 not the best cc programmer not even close but ive known really
 good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory
 management however occasional they may be

ok noone has been toolless for memory management for a long time most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked thats how ive always
done it or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the e tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are

memory management is a nonissue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions granted this takes  minutes to go over and so is far
beyond the scope of the learn java in  minutes without thinking book
every java programmer learned from
