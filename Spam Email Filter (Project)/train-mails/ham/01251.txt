 rh ships the code with the bytecode hinter disabled which makes

 this reqiures only a small change for includefreetypeconfigftoptionh
 it is very well documented

red hat  ships with the bytecode hinter enabled i think  may have 
as well

the enabling change to ftoptionh is made by red hats srpm before 
building  take a look at freetypeenableftbcipatch from the 
srpm its pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done

so if your fonts look ugly lack of bytecode hinting is not the cause
