im not sure since i havent attended civics class
in quite some time but the first amendment doesnt cover protected speech 
hate speech or actions 

the first two are wrong the first amendment does
protect speech the supreme court decides it protects
duh and that happens to include most of what
people consider hate speech unlike many other
nations the us has no laws against hate speech per
se and the first amendment is the reason for that
