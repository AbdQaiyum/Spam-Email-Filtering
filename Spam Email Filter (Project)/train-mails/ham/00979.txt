 sorry i wasnt clear i am transferring messages from my inbox to
 other folders and since i am doing it from most recent to oldest they
 appear in those folders in the wrong order and need resorting

ok gotcha

i dont think you can do that with exmh but you can do it on the
command line if you use sh or ksh

	for f in folders fast r
	do
		echo sorting f 
		sortm f
	done

it could take a long time

at work i have to use outlook  ick  i hate it  but it does a few
things right  like making indices for each folder and not just by
date but also by sender message size subject  so i can sort by any
column instantly

i believe this is possible too with an imap compliant reader
provided the imap server makes such indices

i am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards  i use it for my personal mail  my mail server runs unix
and i connect over ssh and tunnel my x traffic over ssh  with a slow
link this makes exmh very slow  and mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers  i am just scared to move  ive been
using mh or nmh since  and exmh since    years is a long
time
