near the end of his memoirs of extraordinary popular delusions and the
madness of crowds  charles mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in midthcentury london one of them he observes
like a mushroom seems to have sprung up in the night or like a frog in
cheapside to have come down in a sudden shower one day it was unheard
unknown uninvented the next it pervaded london

was like a frog in cheapside or something similar a catch phrase
itself or did mackay come up with the simile on his own

and to what event or events does it refer

i didnt find anything relevant in partridges a dictionary of catch
phrases
