 now for benjamin yea id love to have something like the amazingly cool
 fisher price my first cd casset vasectomy dirtybomb products perhaps
 the my first cd might worktime to let ebay do the walking

sony makes such a line of products

my father was legendary for his abilty to break things  his thumbs of death
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices  after countless numbers of
walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion i
found the sony devices  i got him a my first sony be afraid of the
marketing cd player   it was fire engine red but was completely
indestructible  i hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him  he
complained of its looks but used it nonetheless  i also gave him a pack of
headphones as theres no such things indestuctible headphones that arent
obscenely bulky

now that were riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population how
soon before device makers get wise  not to be morbid but would the marketing
be my last sony  ducks and runs
