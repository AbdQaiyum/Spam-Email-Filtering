 im listed as a developer on sf and have the spambayes cvs module checked
 out using my sf username but im unable to write to the repository  cvs
 complains

      cvs add unheaderpy
     cvs server aborted add requires write access to the repository

 any thoughts

not really  try again  about half the developers on the spambayes project
were missing some permission or other so i ran thru all of them and checked
every damned box and clicked on every damn dropdown list i could find  as
far as sf is concerned youre all sitting on gods right hand now so if it
still doesnt work i suggest you upgrade to win wink
