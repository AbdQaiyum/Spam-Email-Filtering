 i personally dont think imap has a bright future but for people who
 do use it thats certainly a good approach

writing an imap server is a nontrivial task  the specification is huge
and clients do all kinds of weird stuff  pop is very easy in
comparison  perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives

alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
that could be used to review additions to the training set  each day a
few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates
someone would periodically startup the client review the candidates
reclassify or remove any messages they dont like and add them to the
training set
