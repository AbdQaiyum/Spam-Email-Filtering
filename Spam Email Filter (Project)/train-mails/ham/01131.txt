 im home now and this copy of exmh is pretty bad   im running from
 cvs on sunday night  the only change since then was the one you made
 this morning for bulletproofing in mhreadseqs
 
 i run exmh and i can visably see it count up the number of unseen
 messages as it looks through the folders  i have about  unseen
 messages in maybe  or  folders    it takes a few seconds for all
 of the folders in the fcache to turn blue  

this is trueits now looking at more than just unseen so it takes a little 
while in the background to build the sequences window  there is probably 
some tuning possible in this area

 in inbox i have  unread messages  they arent blue they are
 white background with a normal colored font

i changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
messages may be in  i did ask brent before i did it  if you like the old 
behavior the old lines are still in appdefaultscolor but commented out

 if i click on a message i get the following traceback
 
 invalid command name mhmarkseen
     while executing
 mhmarkseen exmhfolder msgid
     procedure hookmsgshowupdateunseen line 
     invoked from within
 cmd mhprofilepathexmhfoldermsgid mimehdr
     procedure msgshow line 
     invoked from within
 msgshow msgid
     procedure msgchange line 
     invoked from within
 msgchange  show
     invoked from within
 time list msgchange msgid show
     procedure msgchange line 
     invoked from within
 msgchange msgnum show
     procedure msgpick line 
     invoked from within
 msgpick lineno show
     procedure ftocrangeend line 
     invoked from within
 ftocrangeend lindex split ftoct index current   
     command bound to event

this is because of your hookmsgshowupdateunseen which is calling a function 
which no longer exists

i suspect you need
	seqdel exmhfolder unseen msgid
now instead of 
	mhmarkseen exmhfolder msgid

 it appears that the message does get marked as seen though as it
 loses the white background and nmh reports the same  
 
 if i click the flist button it zeros the unseen count and then
 there is again a visible delay as it counts up all the unseen 
 messages  maybe  seconds
 
 i really think my installation is ok now but if this behavior is just
 really strange ill blow everything away and reinstall  im happy to
 spend some time helping to track this down i dont really need exmh
 im comfortable enough using nmh
