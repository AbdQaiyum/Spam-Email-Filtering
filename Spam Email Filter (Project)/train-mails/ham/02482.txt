    paul i suspect the best answer is to make the dbm implementation
    paul configurable via bayescustomizeini with the default being
    paul anydbm

i think you might want to specify the database open function instead of just
the module  there are three ways to open db files with bsddb btopen
hashopen rnopen  that will require a little more trickery in optionspy
but not an insane amount
