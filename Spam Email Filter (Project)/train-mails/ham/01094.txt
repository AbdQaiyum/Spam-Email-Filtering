 two issues

 sorry but the following packages have unmet dependencies

 e unmet dependencies try using f

  i have the following openssl packages installed

 snip
 opensslperlb
 opensslb
 opensslaa
 openssldevelb
 snip

 the openssla package should provide the openssla compatibility

 but apt doesnt think so

i believe thats just a matter of string parsing if someone were to fix
the openssh package removing the explicit requires i believe the
automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
install i havent met an openssh like that and in worst case ive had 
different openssl libraries wtf cant they just bump a major version if
its incompatible

  i have postgresql installed from the source so thats why i need
 phppgsql is there a way to tell apt about packages i dont want it to

 complain about

i have a few such things with jdk imlib kernel dri version
something and ive just made dummy packages with verbose warning
attached  that explicitly provide those capabilities or claim to
that is


if you only want to go  miles can you begin with a halfstep
