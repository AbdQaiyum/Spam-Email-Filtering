yes you read the links

sorry but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive  it
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first

brickbats leans heavily on both though the item i highlighted was a
horror item not a gee that is stupid item  for an example of the
latter see the city that wanted a woman to pay a ticket for parking in
an unmarked noparking space
