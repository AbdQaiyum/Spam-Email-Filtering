hash sha


hi 
   i am wondering if there are any techniques to make a cdkey of the like 
unbreakable  either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md signature on the resulting 
executable  i know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it  anyone have hints on this issue 

thanks
