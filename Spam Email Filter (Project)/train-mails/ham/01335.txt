 i would be in favor of creating new spamassassin cvs modules and
 bugzilla categories for other clients provided there is sufficient
 interest and a maintainer

yeah id be with that  as long as they have a maintainer 

however regarding cvs id say many projects might find it easier
to just sign up as a new proj with sfnet  it might save them having
to go through us not sure depends on what sfnets procedures
are like
