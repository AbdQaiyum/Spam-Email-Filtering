 so did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning
  one drawback  they changed from pspell to aspell apparently
 and it requires aspell   which isnt even in rawhide so spell
 checking is disabled for now until i take a decision about it 

oops i didnt see the webpage get updated  i saw the new claws and
checked your site forgot about it for half a day and then posted
here  you beat me once again 

 if i build recent aspell packages they may not be upgraded when
 ungrating to the next red hat linux release the final version of
 the limbos andnull betas which is maybe not really desired ill
 probably test and see

oh yeah i was following this thread in the sylpheedclaws list  very
interesting stuff  i might have to stick w  until aspell gets
updated in red hat
