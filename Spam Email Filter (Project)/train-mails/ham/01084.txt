i throw updates to currents rpms and my own stuff with makefile  to
testing
after each new package 
nice genbasedir s progress topdirtopdir 
testingredhat testing

for s to work you need to make release files pinch someones for
exmple

this stuff is found under apache i put that url my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away

as for fi mirrors funet is very slow i think i use tuxfamily for
updates but when i see errata i usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it
funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects it used to be is
the main mirror for linux it was one of the big pub ftp sites if
there was a definite apt repository maybe they might mirror that as
well i doubt rh would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesnt seem like an easy option someone should just start
a project

 
barry also was quick to point out that the titanium uses torque screws as
opposed to phillips screws were not sure why this matters even a little
bit but barry sure seemed to think it was interesting
thats why mac geeks scare us 	 zdnet powerbook titanium review
