 strange all my openssh packages dont explicitly requires a version of
 openssl what version of openssh do you have is it an official red hat
 package i suppose it isnt and using red hats rpms will solve your
 problem

opensshp

i think that is directly from openssh site its from the rh  that i 
upgraded to   doesnt ship with openssh 

i probably should downgrade to the versoin rh provides except i cant do 
that as i dont have physical access to that box and downgrading ssh 
packages over ssh doesnt sound like a bright idea
