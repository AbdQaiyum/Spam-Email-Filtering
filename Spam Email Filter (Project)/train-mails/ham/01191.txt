hi

red hat  is released tomorrow monday  i took some time out to make 
rpms of gstreamer for it

all of them core plugins and player have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new redhati directory

the repository for dependencies is again called deps and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is redhat because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages

a screenshot of red hat  running gstplayer is up at
httpthomasapestaartorgdownloadscreenshotsredhatgstplayerpng


here are some known issues with the resulting rpms 

a gstreamernautilus isnt built the package got renamed and i dont 
have a devel package for it yet

b the c plugins have problems which i havent been able to resolve
here are the errors

info  gstxmlregistryrebuild plugin 
usrlibgstlibgstwincodecso failed to load error loading plugin 
usrlibgstlibgstwincodecso reason usrliblibaviplayso 
undefined symbol ztvncxxabivsiclasstypeinfoe

plugin usrlibgstlibgstwincodecso failed to load
debug gstpluginloadplugin attempt to load plugin 
usrlibgstlibgstmodplugso
info  gstxmlregistryrebuild plugin 
usrlibgstlibgstmodplugso failed to load error loading plugin 
usrlibgstlibgstmodplugso reason usrlibgstlibgstmodplugso 
undefined symbol gxxpersonalityv

im not sure how to fix this running strings on the libs in usrlib 
reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols so there must 
be something straightforward that should fix this
if anyone has a suggestion please share
