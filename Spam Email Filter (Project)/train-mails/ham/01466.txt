 then there is a third possibility instead of returning a  code
 indicating youre on to the spammer fake a  response which is
 saying mailbox does not exist this would be in the hopes that some
 spammers out there actually remove names reported as nonexistent from
 their lists i know a slim hope but even if only a few do it can
 lower the incidence
 
 they dont i can guarantee that  quite a few spamtraps nowadays
 operate by nning for  months in the hope of getting legit mailers
 to remove bouncing addrs from lists  then after  months they just
 spamtrap all incoming mail to those addrs  unfortunately a lot of
 legit mailers dont bother cleaning their lists either

most spammers dont check reply codes at all they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation

a trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago answer all incoming mail with a xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time and accept it the second time apparently most
massemailers dont even try to deliver a second time
