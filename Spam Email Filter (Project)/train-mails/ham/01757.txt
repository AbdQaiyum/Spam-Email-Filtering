 why would spam be likely to end up with two instances of returnpath
 in the headers

greg ward
 possibly another qmailism from bruce guenters spam collection

doesnt seem likely as it appeared in about  of about  spams
it could be specific to one of his bait addresses though  dont know  a
nice thing about a statistical inferencer is that you really dont have to
know why a thing works just whether it works wink

 or maybe anthonys right about spammers being stupid and blindly copying
 headers well of course hes right about spammers being stupid its
 just this particular aspect of stupidity thats open to question

im going to blow it off  its just another instance of being pointlessly
baffled by a mixed corpus half of which i dont know enough about
