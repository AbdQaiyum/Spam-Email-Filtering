an apparent quote from dubya from the times sent to me by my dad

httpwwwtimesonlinecoukprintfriendlyhtml


tony blairs special relationship with george w bush is under
considerable strain not only do the two disagree on yassir arafats
tenure as leader of the palestinian authority but blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the president

baroness williams of crosby recalled a story told to her by my good
friend tony blair recently in brighton blair bush and jacques
chirac were discussing economics and in particular the decline of
the french economy the problem with the french bush confided in
blair is that they dont have a word for entrepreneur
