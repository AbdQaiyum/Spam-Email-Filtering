all mozilla did is steal netscapes thunder 

true but if netscape had actually bothered to put valuable additions into its 
product then that wouldnt have happened similarly if netscape hadnt taken 
away valuable features from mozilla then maybe people would actually want to 
use netscape over mozilla
