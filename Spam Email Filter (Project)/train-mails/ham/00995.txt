  youre probably running exmh on a local machine  im running it on a
  very remote machine  in this scenario the mime handling is weak
 
 nope  i run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
 exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops gratis
 ssh x forwarding

i run exmh routinely from home broadband using an xwindows client tunneled through ssh under ahem winxp  it works very well in this fashion

fwiw i use eudora under winder because its less of a virus magnet  

theres more to the story why i run winder but thats really offtopic and im already guilty
