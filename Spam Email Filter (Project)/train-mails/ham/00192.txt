    a im not displeased youre trying to help just frustrated that
    a employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills
    a with insane years of experience

from my  years in the playing field imho the art of jobhunting
for those not yet dejobbed is the art of getting past the hrstage
interview and into the engineertoengineer interview  hr is not
being honest with you so theres no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them if they want experience numbers that would place you
in the oak project lead them to believe that you have something
roughly equivalent ie it wasnt  years but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime  they are playing a bluff in saying
they know the job requirements so youre perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it

if you dont have the requisite right stuff the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview  most
often their choice is based  on who can i work with and only
maybe  on how muchlittle will we have to tutor this candidate
