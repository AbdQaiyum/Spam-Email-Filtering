date t

i guess its time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation i received as 
many of you may have found out or guessed i will be attending oral argument 
for the eldred case before the supreme court 

im incredibly excited as you might imagine visiting the supreme court would 
be quite enough but seeing such an important casedayenu when lessig asked 
me if i was free that day to come i laughed because i couldnt and still 
cant think of anything id rather do than attend i am eternally grateful to 
lessig for the chance to attend on the other hand im sort of embarassed to 
have the opportunity when there are surely others who deserve it far more than 
me luckily it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by 
camping in line with us 

so ill be arriving in dc on tuesday attending an 
eldreddukeepicbookmobile superparty and then camping in line with seth 
schoen lisa rein jace cooke but unfortunately not cory doctorow if youd 
like to come with us let me know 

i was hoping id be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who 
couldnt make it but as i read in todays times only lawyers and those with 
official press credentials are allowed to take notes i think this is 
outrageous but hopefully i will be able to remember enough to provide an 
interesting account 

in a related irony today was disney day at borders where they played 
disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud disturbing my usual habit 
of reading a book there however i did manage to skim through the practice of 
programming 

in an unrelated note if you havent been electrocuted by a model t spark plug 
i highly recommend it
