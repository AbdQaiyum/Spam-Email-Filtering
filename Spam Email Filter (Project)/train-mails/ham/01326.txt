 the ga run on the current corpus is yielding an average mean 
 score for falsepositives of about  points which is higher 
 than before  theres some tweaking to be done yet rule 
 elimination and such so that will likely fall but  might 
 not be enough of a correction in many situations  i will set 
 the scores for the habeas stuff and the ironport stuff to be 
 sensible given
 
 a estimated likeliness of compliance with habeasbonded sender 
 rules and
 b score correction level needed to achieve purposes of those projects

using the scoreranges stuff and my aggressive antifp evaluation code
btw yielded an average fp of  points with  fps and 
overall accuracy  but i notice you went back to the other method
just pointing this out
