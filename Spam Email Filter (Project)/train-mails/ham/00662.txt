just tried smartgroups the layout of pages is pretty challenging to
use quickly but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in
there is no way to get out  you can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
member of a group but you cannot delete the group

or if you can i couldnt find it before deleting myself and now its
invisible to me  another interesting thing security forms are reset
to fullpublic settings each time you load them rather than set from
your current settings

all in all i wasnt impressed and have stayed with the yahooligans
for another run
