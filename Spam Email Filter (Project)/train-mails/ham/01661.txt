so then guido van rossum guidopythonorg is all like

  basic procmail usage goes something like this
  
      fw
       spamassassin p
  
      
       xspamstatus yes
      spam
  
 
 do you feel capable of writing such a tool  it doesnt look too hard

not to beat a dead horse but thats exactly what my spamcan package
did  for those just tuning in spamcan is a thingy i wrote before i
knew about tim  cos work on this crazy stuff you can download it from
httpwoozleorgnealesrcspamcanspamcanhtml but im not going
to work on it anymore

im currently writing a new one based on classifier and timtests
bootykicking tokenizer  ill probably have something soon like maybe
half an hour and no its not too hard  the hard part is storing the
data somewhere  i dont want to use zodb as id like something a
person can just drop in with a default python install  so anydbm is
looking like my best option

i already have a setup like this using xavier leroys spamoracle which
does the same sort of thing  you call it from procmail it adds a new
header and then you can filter on that header  really easy

heres how i envision this working  everybody gets four new mailboxes

  traineggs
  trainspam
  trainedeggs
  trainedspam

you copy all your spam and eggs into the train boxes as you get it
how frequently you do this would be up to you but youd get better
results if you did it more often and youd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified  then every night the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam  after shes
done she moves your mail into the trained folders

this would work for anybody using imap on a unix box or folks who read
their mail right off the server  ive spoken with some fellows at work
about exchange and they seem to beleive that exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well

advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key s to move to trainspam and h to move to
traineggs  eventually if enough people used this sort of thing itd
start showing up in mail clients  thats the delete as spam button
paul graham was talking about

 the hormel company might not think well of using the word ham as the
  opposite of spam and theyve been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far  so i propose we start calling
  nonspam something more innocuous and more monty pythonic such as
  eggs
