 that is if you concede that of the two founding branches only the
 one founded by the nyabingi were legit and the others were
 thinlyveneered anticolonial hooligans  
 there is also vietnamese buddhism unless you count setting fire to
 oneself as a foul action

what about tibetan buddhism btw  they seem like an awfully nice bunch
of chaps and chapesses

 when we launched the native net in  one of the first things we
 noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
 british army with the us army as a proxy by extension were the
 common thread  where neither was present physically or through
 influence there tended to be less violence
 
 the issue in ireland is complex but rest assured that religious
 aspects are only a coincidence of the invadercolonials being
 predominantly members of the royalheaded anglicans and the aboriginal
 population being predominantly members of the popeheaded catholics
 the conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice since
 the anglican church is a nearidentical clone of catholicism
 
 now i bet thats going to attract some healthy debate 

man im not going there again   ill agree though that the ideology
or practices of the religions have very little to do with the conflict

 the same is true of streetgangs when people are disenfranchised
 its easier to offer them the triad as a new family  you get
 cellphones cars a dry place to live  triad biker gangs mafia the
 ira al queda  weve been fighting the war on terrorism for as long
 as theres been commerce so youd think wed realize that
 escalation of violence is not a solution
