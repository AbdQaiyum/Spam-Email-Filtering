    but lets walk before we run  after all we may end up
    all using zodb in any case 

id like this despite the additional installation burden  we can ship
binaries for windows and mac and not only for technical reasons  as i
understand it postx versions of the core bsddb code ship under the
sleepycat license which demands that projects using it must be
publishedsource  this is a problem if we want spambayes to be fully
psflicensed  if someone wants to take the spambayes source and fund their
addictions by creating a commercial closedsource spamfilter product the
psf license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb  not that im
in favour of people making money from spambayes unless its me  but the
psf license does allow for it  it should be all or nothing  or do i have
this all wrong

slightly ot this has concerned me since plabs announced that they were
integrating bsddb into python   its going to make it very easy
especially on windows for someone to write code that uses anydbm wrap it
up with pyexe and ship it under a commercial license not knowing that
theyre breaking the sleepycat license  theyve never heard of sleepycat
software or even bsddb  as far as theyre concerned this bsddbpyd file
that pyexe tells them they need to ship is just another part of python
like socketpyd or selectpyd
