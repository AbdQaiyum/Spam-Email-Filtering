 perhaps more useful would be if tim could check in the pickles
 generated by one of his training runs so that others can see how
 tims training data performs against their own corpora

i did that yesterday but seems like nobody bit  just in case wink i
uploaded a new version just now  since mincount went away unknownspamprob
is much less likely and theres almost nothing that can be pruned away so
the file is about x larger now

 this could also be the starting point for a selfcontained distribution
 youve got to start with something and training with pythonlist data
 seems just as good as anything else

the only way to know anything here is for someone to try it
