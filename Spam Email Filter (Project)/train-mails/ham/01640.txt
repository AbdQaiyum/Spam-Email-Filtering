    gw if you and guido barry et al prefer i could change that
    gw last statement to folder  none so the mail wont be saved
    gw at all

i dont care if the mail is foldered on pythonorg but personal
messages regardless of who theyre for shouldnt be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender

note also that we are much more liberal about pythonorgzopeorg
mailing list traffic than most folks  read listmanagers for any
length of time and youll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections are very protective of
their traffic and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking

which might be an appropriate for their lists but not for ours dont
think im suggesting we do the same  i like our laissezfaire
approach

but for personal email we should be more careful
