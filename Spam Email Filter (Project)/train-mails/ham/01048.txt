 i am now relaxed again  and pass this info on probably matthias saou
 himself is dude and some package has hardwired a path in his build
 directory it would be nice to find out which and fix it but i am using
 too many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down

indeed my usual login is dude and has been since long before the big
lebowsky came out  and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code
my home directory when being compiled 
for instance 

dudepython dude strings usrbingentoo  grep dude
homedude
dudepython dude strings usrbinxine  grep dude
homeduderedhattmpxinerootusrsharelocale

these should probably be considered bugs in the programs build process
especially for xine look at that ill report them upstream ifwhen i
have some time

thanks for noticing this
matthias
