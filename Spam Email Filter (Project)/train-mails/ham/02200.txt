interview with cartoonist ted rall who has traveled to south asia recently 
and has tips on how to deal with bribehungry border guards and the like 

    rall now i realize thats just the way it is and i know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe or paying something very modest you have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you dont have to 
    give them anything and just have a lowkey demeanor but if you get angry 
    thats just going to make things worse for you you get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them  you dont try to avoid these guys you dont try 
    to avoid their eyes  you go up with a big smile give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say hey great to see you 
    youre my new best friend for the next five minutes 

    groth basically act like a used car salesman 

    rall its exactly like that you always carry cigarettes you offer them a 
    cigarette and you say hey whats goin on hows it goin great 
    heres my documents hows the road just small talk because these guys 
    are bored theyre in the middle of nowhere and youre sometimes the only 
    vehicle theyve seen for many hours theyre often very drunk so you just 
    have to be cool
