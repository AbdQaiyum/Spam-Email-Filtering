 after my latest cvs up timtest fails with

     traceback most recent call last
       file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in 
         drivensets
       file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in drive
         d  driver
       file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in init
         selfglobalhamhist  histoptionsnbuckets
     attributeerror optionsclass object has no attribute nbuckets

 im running it as

     timtest n  datatimtestout

 from my mail directory not from my srcspambayes directory  if i
 create a symlink to srcspambayesbayesini it works once again but
 shouldnt there be an nbuckets attribute with a default value already

i never used configparser before but i read that its read method silently
ignores files that dont exist  if bayesini isnt found none of the
options will be defined  since you want to run this from a directory other
than my spambayes directory its up to you to check in changes to make that
possible wink
