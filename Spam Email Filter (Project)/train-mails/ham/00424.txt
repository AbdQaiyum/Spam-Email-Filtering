our preschoolers  and  use winamp with a pokemon skin  its the
yrold who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite mp playlist

what we need is a good barely literate email program  years ago
the university of hawaii had a word processor that included a
voiceassist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed even further back there was a dos shareware editor
that did that latter function extremely well targetted at the
handicapped  with just those little bits of assists maybe some
clever use of pictograms too i bet kindergarten kids could handle
email
