ok if an email address is not in my whitelist they are asked to confirm
in that message there is the following text

    if your message was an unsolicited message attempting to sell
    kevin some product or advertise one scam or another then do not
    reply to this message  if you do reply and he has some free time
    on his hands hell find out who and where you are and send you his
    review of your email and an invoice for eur  for his services
    plus hell probably try to patch me in some unpleasant way so please
    dont reply if youre one of those people

in addition all of this information is logged  in the past two to three
months two spammers have replied  i think that this is a valid notice
what im wondering is the following

    a  are there debt collection agencies you can hire to get such debts
    b  if i cant get money from them can i declare them on my taxes
	here as a bad debt and get tax relief

one way to get the govt to notice spam
