once upon a time roi wrote 

 the new spec didnt even want to build the package
 something with configmak

now that is weird 

 also this new spec looks like the old one it got libdv and libdvdevel
 in the buildrequires so i just used the normal spec and removed it
 manully

indeed my booboo  fixed now

btw about the mplayer vo sdl black screen problem you reported i was
unable to reproduce it on my hom  computer it worked as expected
