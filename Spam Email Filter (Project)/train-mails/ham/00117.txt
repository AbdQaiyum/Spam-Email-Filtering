a new theory on mapping the new world

in  a group of scholars working in france produced an extraordinary map
of the world the first to put the stillrecent discoveries of columbus and
others into a new continent separate from asia and to call that continent
america with the waldseemuller map the new world was born
but there was something else what would later come to be called south
america and central america were surprisingly wellshaped not only on the
east coast where explorers had already sailed but also on the west coast
 which no european was known to have seen
the ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the pacific at the junction of
modernday chile and peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot  not only in the main map but also in an inset printed
along its top
the shape of south america in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the earth
it is an improbable coincidence if it was a coincidence for the map  
large printed pages to be arrayed in one squarefoot wall display  was
published six years before vasco balboas  trip across the isthmus of
panama and  years before ferdinand magellans  trip around the
world
did someone get there earlier
