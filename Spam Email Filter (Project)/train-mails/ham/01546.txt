  these messages could end up being falsely or incorrectly reported
    to razor dcc pyzor etc  certain rbls too  i dont think the
    results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way
    shape or form when running over a public corpus

ill note that in the readme

  these messages could also be submitted more than once to projects
    like spamassassin that rely on filtering results submission for ga
    tuning and development
 the second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a nilsimsa
 signature or similar to the masscheck file the results format used
 by spamassassin and giving the message files unique names md or
 sha of each file

ok maybe rewriting the messageids will help here that should allow
us to pick them out  ill do that

  spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
    filters  and of course theres always progression in technology
    by both spammers and nonspammers
 the third problem doesnt really worry me

nah me neither

 these problems and perhaps others i have not identified are unique
 to spam filtering  compression corpuses and other performancerelated
 corpuses have their own set of problems of course
 
 in other words i dont think theres any replacement for having
 multiple independent corpuses  finding better ways to distribute
 testing and collate results seems like a more viable longterm solution
 and im glad were working on exactly that for spamassassin  if
 youre going to seriously work on filter development building a corpus
 of  messages half spamhalf nonspam is not really that
 much work  if you dont get enough spam creating multitechnique
 spamtraps web usenet replying to spam is pretty easy  and who
 doesnt get thousands of nonspam every week  

yep  the primary reason i released this was to provide a good big
corpus for academic testing of filter systems it allows results to
be compared between filters using a known corpus

for spamassassin development everyone has to maintain their own corpus
