  in adding cream to spaghetti carbonara which has the same effect on pasta as
  making a pizza a deeppie 

i just had to jump in here as carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream  ive never seen a 
recipe that hasnt used this  personally i use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time ive seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine cream eggs and lots of fresh parmesan 
except for the creme fraiche
