 it seems that something changed during the last  weeks
 
  in a folder msgs n is read ncurrent n upwards is unread
  change to another folder
  change back to the original folder and youll see msg n being 
 highlighted as current for a split second that it changes back to 
 ncurrent
 
 kind of annoying since it marks msg n as read

i havent seen what you describe but i just saw something close to what you 
describe  i think the message thats being incorrectly highlighted as current
is related to the current message in the other folder rather than being n

ill have to investigate a bit more to identify and fix the bug but there is 
something going on here
