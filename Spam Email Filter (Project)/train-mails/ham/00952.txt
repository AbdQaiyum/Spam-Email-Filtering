 just one more info i measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
 ftocnext with time  so the data is for real one difference 
 between mine and valdis setup judging from his trace is that i use 
 the address book ive been doing that for ages so that cant be the 
 problem

assuming its my fault which it probably is since nobody else has really been 
in there its most likely related to the number of sequences in a folder  
id guess that something is either being called that shouldnt be or is being 
called more times than it should be

 is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity

not that im aware of  if you look in the code there are various places 
where the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do 
things  youll probably want to borrow that technique
