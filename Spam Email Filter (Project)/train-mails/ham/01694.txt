so then tim peters timonecomcastnet is all like

 im not sure what youre doing but suspect youre storing individual
 wordinfo pickles  if so most of the administrative pickle bloat is
 due to that and doesnt happen if you pickle an entire classifier
 instance directly

yeah thats exactly what i was doingi didnt realize i was incurring
administrative pickle bloat this way  im specifically trying to make
things faster and smaller so im storing individual wordinfo pickles
into an anydbm dict keyed by token  the result is that its almost 
times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail s vs
s

however it does say all over the place that the goal of this project
isnt to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so i guess
ill hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
to point more in that direction   seconds is probably fast enough for
people to use it in their procmailrc which is what i was after

 if youre desparate to save memory write a subclass

thats probably what ill do if i get too antsy 

trying to think of ways to sneak administrative pickle boat into
casual conversation
