   the total collections are  messages  i trained with 
   messages

  tp im reading this now as that you trained on about  spam and
  tp about  ham  thats less than  of the sizes of the
  tp training sets ive been using  please try an experiment train
  tp on  of each and test once against the other  of each

this helps a lot  here are results with the stock tokenizer

training on mbox homejeremymailinbox   mbox homejeremymailspam 
   hams   spams
        
         
         
training on mbox homejeremymailinbox   mbox homejeremymailspam 
   hams   spams
         
         
         
training on mbox homejeremymailinbox   mbox homejeremymailspam 
   hams   spams
         
         
         
training on mbox homejeremymailinbox   mbox homejeremymailspam 
   hams   spams
         
         
         
total false pos  
total false neg  

and results from the tokenizer that looks at all headers except date
received and xfrom

training on mbox homejeremymailinbox   mbox homejeremymailspam 
   hams   spams

   hams   spams
         
         
         
total false pos  
total false neg  

is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a
good thing

  tp do that a few times making a random split each time it wont be
  tp long until you discover why directories of individual files are
  tp a lot easier to work  eg randomshuffle makes this kind
  tp of thing trivial for me

you havent looked at mboxtestpy have you  im using
randomshuffle too  you dont need to have many files to make an
arbitrary selection of messages from an mbox

ill report some more results when theyre done
