what takes time and money noting the amounts of each correction and basing
the refund delivery method on the amount  yesh its silly to spend  
labor and materials for a  refund but maybe the only alternative right
now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor  or keep
the money see john hall below  your mailed refund is a function of bulk

in jax were on the verge of firing att cable for horrible customer service
and overcharging  what will probably happen if the amount of overage per
customer is significant say  or more the refund will go directly to the
customer  if its less the combined total amount will go to the city as
lump sum settlement

in your case maybe all the customers could vote on line where theyd like
their lump sum to go  of courese theyd have to be notified by mail first

they are legally required to do that  i got a similar check because an
insurance company didnt pay a claim quickly enough  it might have been


although they spent lots more than  to mail you the check the
alternative seems to be to keep the money  do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to overbill you just a bit so they
could keep it  for a company with millions of customers customer
starts adding up

 so i get a check from pac bell today sbc as theyre called now
 turns out they went to the trouble of printing out signing sealing
 and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole 

 they easily spent more than this just getting the materials together
 why the hell do companies bother to do this crap  i mean isnt there
 a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness  i dont think i missed
 the  but i sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu
 of being returned pennies

 im truly stuck on this though  i dont know whether to frame the
 check burn it or cash it in  maybe i should find a way to return to
 sender so they have to spend more money on giving me my  dues


 does  even buy anything anymore  funny bit of it is i couldnt
 even make a phone call these days
