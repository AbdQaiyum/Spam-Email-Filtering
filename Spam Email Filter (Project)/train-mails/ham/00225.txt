lima peru reuters  lina medinas parents thought their yearold daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in perus andes could find no cure her father carried her to hospital 

just over a month later she gave birth to a boy 

aged  years seven months and  days old when her child was born by caesarean section in may  medina made medical history and is still the youngest known mother in the world 

at the time perus government promised aid that never materialized six decades on medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor crimeridden district of the peruvian capital known as little chicago 

now  she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past gerardo the son she delivered while still a child herself died in  at the age of  

but a new book written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case has drawn fresh attention to medinas story and raised the prospect that the peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance 

the government condemned them to live in poverty in any other country they would be the objects of special care jose sandoval author of mother aged  told reuters 

we still have time to repair the damage done to her thats my fundamental objective he added 

totally willing to help
sandoval has raised medinas case with the office of first lady eliane karp and has asked the government to grant her a life pension  something officials say is possible 

were totally willing to help her said spokeswoman marta castaneda but suni ramos of the social action department of karps office said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning  such as kitchen and other household equipment  it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed it is currently trying to contact medina and her family 

medinas husband raul jurado told reuters his wife remained skeptical she got no help in  that i know about he said she thinks governments never deliver maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true 

jurado said his wife whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists had turned down reuters request for an interview 

medical rarity
no one has ever established who was the father of medinas child or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped 

one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo an andean village at an altitude of  feet  meters in perus poorest province medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history sandoval said 

he said she had her first period at   became pregnant aged  years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby they found she already had fully mature sexual organs 

her swelling stomach worried her parents they thought it was a tumor he said but shamans ruled out village superstitions  including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them  and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town pisco 

there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant 

her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest  he was later released for lack of evidence  and doctors police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case 

sandoval who based his book on media and other published information and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment said news of the child mothertobe drew instant offers of aid including one worth  from a us businessman which was turned down 

more offers followed after medina was transferred to a lima hospital where her fully developed pound  kg baby was born on may    mothers day 

one offer was worth  a week plus expenses for medina and her baby to be exhibited at the worlds fair in new york another from a us business that the family accepted in early june  was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort 

but within days the state trumped all previous offers decreeing that medina and her baby were in moral danger and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them 

but sandoval said it abandoned the case after six months it did absolutely nothing for them 

happy ending
though physically mature medina  who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms  still behaved like a child preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby who was fed by a wet nurse 

medina stayed in hospital for  months finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again 

after taunting from schoolmates gerardo  who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor  discovered when he was  that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother 

he died in  from a disease that attacks the bodys bone marrow but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young 

medina married and in  had a second son  years after her first her second child now lives in mexico 

she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject we just want to get on with our lives thats it said jurado adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the worlds youngest mother 

he said the couples main concern now if the governments offer of aid was genuine was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the thengovernment expropriated more than two decades ago that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site 

he said its value was more or less  and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own  they live now in a modest house accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise 

if the government really wants to helpthey should give us the value of our property he said 

as for sandoval he said he was optimistic that medinas story which he has studied since his student days would turn out well i believe there will be a happy ending he said 

as a result of the war corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the moneypower of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the republic is destroyed
