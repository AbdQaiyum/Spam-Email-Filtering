well i dont think china could force yahoo to give up info  so if they 
are so willing to give it why wouldnt they be willing to give info to 
some silly group who may one day decide to get a hair up their ass about 
the practice of bdsmers not to mention folks who dont even practice 
but who are just interested in information what about folks who are 
interested in talking about software security issues  didja read about 
the guy in china who got  years for downloading and printing out prodemocracy

 im a bit confused about this boycott thing  how is what china is
 doing any different than having scientology and who ever else
 stateside who takes the whim evoking the dmca to close down foreign
 sites they deem inappropriate  at least the chinese make it voluntary
 and ask politely rather than just sending legal musclemen first off
