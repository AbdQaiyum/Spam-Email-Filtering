 are there any reasons not to use the new apt releases on rh x

hmmm i dont see any 

my main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages ive made for
psyche on valhalla id need to lower the release tag to keep an
upgrade working and that would fck up my cvs repository which is on my
valhalla box well im exagerating itll just make it more difficult for
me 
sure there are easy ways around this but the easiest for me will be to
wait until i upgrade my main box to psyche and have valhalla only on a
secondary rebuild system
