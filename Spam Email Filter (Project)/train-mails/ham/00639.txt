whos the real monster


it seems good ol uncle dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him  it seems ben kevin and bill are making too
strong a case  so here we daves attempt to fool you into thinking theyre
some sort of monsters violent ones no less

anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their
way

yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe

the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving rss in general  each with their own brand of attitude to be
sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward  how is that being monstrous

is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the publics
perception of them  if you havent already contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness

dave deflects what he cant take the time to understand


its really quite pitiful  when normal people dont understand something
they usually try learning about it  they read up ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it  this before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools

what dave does is just the opposite

posts a link to something he doesnt understand
gets a bunch of email from people who do understand it
derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it
expects others to do research for him
abuses anyone who tries to help him
pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue
realizes hes been a fool but refuses to correct himself
plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
tries making the educated people look like fools
sends private emails to them trying to scare them off
exposes any private email they write out of context
deflects and runs off to some new topic repeats from 
his continued diatribes about rss and its use of rdf reveal this to be
true  dave doesnt get the idea of the semantic web  hed rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying

one reader wrote to us with a good analogy  its like that movie the
poseidon adventure  daves like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow  i dont know about
you but id rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room
the ships fucking sinking and i dont want to be following the idiot

daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around  youre supposed to just shut up and take it  after all why would
good ol uncle dave want to hurt you  its all about love right  to hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted  and if you dare complain he
savages you  then he tries to make everyone think youre the one causing
all the trouble

weve news for you dave were wise to your tactics and were talking
amongst ourselves about it  were routing around you damaging behavoir
thats where were coming from

if you have an example of how youve tried to help dave please drop us an
email about it  well keep it strictly confidential of course  send it
along to zaphodegroupscom

trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig


the trouble is you get dirty and the pig seems to like it

another developer tries talking to dave and discovers its fundamentally
impossible

his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web
developers are doing a terrible job

in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot

the zaphodim however are veteran pig wrestlers  if youve got a similar
tale from the mud pit be sure to drop us a line at zaphodegroupscom

aha some backing down by the whining one


it would appear the dictator release strategy that daves been trying on
his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support

im going to push back the caveatremoving on the  spec by  hours
still have work to do on the sample file i want to look into the rfc for
timedate specs and get started on the radio implementation of  i have
to prepare for seybold tomorrow and i want to a little memorial for  a
busy few days for a guy still recovering also it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the  spec and see if there are any
dealstoppers

hell yeah there are deal stoppers like nobody wants it nor will they use
it

the poor radio customers  the poor salon blog users  theyre going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use  so
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage

ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected

of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card  what utter
fucking nonsense  this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his
blame america bullshit  then the rss community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of rss  now hes trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because hes still recovering

uh dave if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights  well still kick your ass regardless  thats what years of your
abusing people has gotten you dave  no sympathy anymore none whatsoever

luserland attempts to trademark rss


dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt scripting news is full of examples

so we found it surprising as did many others when luserland software tried
to patent the term rss back in  heres the patent application

httptarrusptogovservlettarrregserserialentry

this was apparently just between the start of the rss  development
efforts and the publication of the specification winer knew about the rss
 stuff  indeed he complained about it bitterly at the time

could dave be any more transparent

since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do a good quote from before he filed the patent application

tim oreilly says patents are ok hes just against stupid patents in the
spirit of touch of grey tim man patents are lockin of the worst kind
theres no way to route around them

whens a permalink not a permalink


when dave writes an item then removes it the permalink links to
nothing at that point so apparently the perma part in permalink is
permanent for everyone except dave too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this
