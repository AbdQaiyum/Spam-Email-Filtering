  im not sure what exactly is wrong with this but i cant get a redhat
  box to use ttys as a console
 
  the relevant bits of bootgrubgrubconf are
 
 serial unit speed
 terminal timeout console serial
 titlelinux
    root hd
    kernel bootbzimage ro rootdevmd consolettysn
															     
that  is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel

we use consolettysn but the  is mainly cos we are a cisco
shop and its to keepo everyhting the same

design is like a religion  too much of it makes you inflexibly and unpopular
