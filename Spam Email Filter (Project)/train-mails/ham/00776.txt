bob

    living aboard a cessna  would be challenging but i did meet a
couple at an airshow in point mugu in  or so that had converted an
old seaplane it was a bit larger than a pby i think to something of a
floating flying rv  they visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of
miles  im sure maintenance on a  year old airframe fuel for two
large radial engines insurance and other costs were out of my price
range but what a hoot

    on a more realistic note the flight to half moon bay was probably 
hours of flight time at about  hour in the cessna  not exactly a
cheap date but thats nothing compared to the money ive spent on her
since  and loved every minute of it darling

  proving once again that aviators get all the chicks

 just as long as they have the wherewithal
 for avgas anyway

 i think turpin once calculated that one
 could do a decent amount of messing about
 for about k of boat and kyear in
 living expenses

 what are the equivalent figures for live
 aboard aircraft

 dave

 how difficult would it be to find the
 harbormaster after mooring to the top
 of the empire state building
