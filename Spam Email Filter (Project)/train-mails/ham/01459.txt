  i faced a similar problem with the freebsd when trying to 
 install spamassassin through the ports on my fresh freebsd  
 i had to define perllib with some given order of directories
 so that the latest filespec module get used 

good to hear its not just me  mind telling me how you set perllib
specificly ive tried a few things setenv in the shell as well as
perllib  inside the makefilepl even on the perl command
line with no success

thanks
