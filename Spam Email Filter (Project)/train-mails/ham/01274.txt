  eek  maybe its just me but i dont think thats a good idea 
  outputting a message in post and providing a readme of some kind would
  be better as well as perhaps adding a note in description
 
 why eek 
 if no devdvd exists itll create it
 if devdvd exists it wont touch it

i assume that you wont ghost or remove these and the modulesconf
change on uninstall though  so people who are installing this rpm and
are unfortunate enough to have a dvd drive or just an ordinary cd
nondvd drive that doesnt support dma will be left with a system
without a working cd drive even after removing the rpm  and without
ever knowing what struck them  you cant remove the dma setting from
modulesconf either unless youre sure that ogle added it there and
nothing else needs it

the dev stuff isnt that dangerous but the modulesconf change can
be  thats why eek 

 if someone installs ogle a dvd player im assuming the hardware is
 recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a dvdrom all
 of them support dma but since that change requires a reboot or a manual
 change im still hesitating to integrate it 

a worthy goal

 my goal is to allow users to install a dvd player through synaptic and play
 dvds in no time outputting a message in the post section of a package is
 always a bad idea putting the tip in the description sounds good though

how about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modulesconf
modifications into a separate rpm
