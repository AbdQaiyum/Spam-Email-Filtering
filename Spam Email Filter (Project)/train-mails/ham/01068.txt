  you cant get the file index from here either
  httpaptnixianoaptfiles
 
 the requested url aptfiles was not found on this server

very strange then  it works fine from here even shiftreloading and with
no proxy whatsoever

  during the past few days ive experienced connection problems with
  that site from time to time but for me right now its working
 
 maybe its temporary 

if you need another apt repository with red hat linux  files there are
a few others see  httpfreshrpmsnetapt
