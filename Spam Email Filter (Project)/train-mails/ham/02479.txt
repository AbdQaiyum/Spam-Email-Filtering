i dont know how one can expect better and more secure code from the
community when this being a security list some post like this shows
clearly no knowledge of c

 here is a test done on the return of sizes by sizeof using pointers
 
 include iostreamh
 
 int mainvoid 
  char testbuff
   

read it like this new array with  elements of type pointer to char
as a pointer occupies the natural word size  bits or bits no wonder
you get  sizeofchar   numerofelements

  int len  sizeoftestbuff
  cout  len  n
  return 
 

 using  int len  sizeofchartestbuff 
sizeof returns the size of types you can use it with vars and then the
normal form is sizeof var not sizeofvar but if youre changing the
type with the var with a cast of course youll get the size of that new
type
