    tim i gave it all the thought it deserved wink  it would be
    tim wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test data and
    tim im all in favor of that  otoh my data subtree currently has
    tim more than  files slobbering over  million bytes  even if
    tim i had a place to put that much stuff im not sure my isp would let
    tim me email it in one msg wink

do you have a dialup or something more modern wink  mb of messages
zipped would probably compress pretty well  under mb id guess with all
the similarity in the headers and such  you could zip each of the  sets
individually and upload them somewhere

    tim can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample
    tim apart from a public mailing list  everyones eager to share their
    tim spam but spam is so much alike in so many ways thats the easy
    tim half of the data collection problem

how about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar manually cleaning it distributing that load over a
number of people and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it  the problem with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person not just intimate but unique than the
spam

i save all incoming email for ten days gzipped mbox format before it rolls
over and disappears  at any one time i think i have about 
messages  most of it isnt terribly personal which i would cull before
passing along anyway and much of it is machinegenerated so would be of
marginal use  finally its all hamnspam mixed together  do we call that
an omelette or a dennys grand slam

skip
