 ahh wonderful  just tried out these and finally got sound working
 with my abit thiiraids integrated audio  ive been pulling hair
 together with the helpful opensound people for quite some time now
 but weve failed to get sound to work either with the drivers included
 in kernel or the commercial oss
 
 thanks a lot   the rpms seem to be fine they worked for me out of
 the box on vanilla valhalla wlatest errata

except that i dont see an init script in the rpms a sample one
designed for rh is supposed to be in utilsalsasound  could you take
a look if it can be included

cheers
