 there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale picketts
 hammiepy and the original gbayespy  according to the readmetxt
 gbayespy hasnt been kept up to date

it seemed that way to me when i ripped the classifier out of it  i dont
think anyone has touched it after

 is there anything in there that isnt covered by hammiepy

someone else will have to answer that i dont use gbayes or hammie at
least not yet

 about the only useful feature of gbayespy that hammiepy doesnt yet
 copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox  this
 feature can easily be copied into hammiepy

thats been done now right

 gbayespy also has a large collection of tokenizers but timtokenpy
 rules so im not sure how interesting that is now

those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if theyre
interesting  the tiny spamham collections in gbayes are also worthless
now  the self test feature didnt do anything except print its results
testerpy since became doctested and verifies that some basic machinery
actually delivers what its supposed to deliver

 therefore i propose to nuke gbayespy after adding a u feature

 here

 anyone against
