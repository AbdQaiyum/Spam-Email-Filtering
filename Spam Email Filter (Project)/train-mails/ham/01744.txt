weve not only reduced the fp and fn rates in my test runs weve also
made the score distributions substantially sharper  this is bad news for
greg because the nonexistent middle ground is becoming even less
existent wink

as usual for me this is an aggregate of  runs each both training and
predicting on  clpy ham   bruceg spam

only  ham scores out of  are above  now and yes the
nigerian scamquoting msg is still counted as ham  i havent taken
anything out of the ham corpus since remving the if aol were a car spam
the fp rate wouldnt have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were
dropped from  to  dropping the cutoff to  would have added
only  false positives and dropping it to  would have added only
another  more

its spooky
