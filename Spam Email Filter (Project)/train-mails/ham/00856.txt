  and the one thing i think weve learned in all that time is that
 as a helpdesk it doesnt work
im not sure they are doing strictly helpdesk stuff
but the whole who in their right mind would use that it doesnt have all
these cool features isnt always a guarantee of failure  maybe there is a
strength in this approach agents andor im as ui than can find a nich
application space


 in all the prologbased nl database query systems of the s and
 other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like shallow red even
 simpler tries like ask jeeves people very quickly know theyre
 talking to a robot and the queries anneal to short truncated and
 terse databaselike verbnoun or just nounkeyword requests
kind of like a web query  and with google someone else can turn them into
a link so you dont even have to type anything


 people are just too quick to adapt and too impatient to forgive a
 clunky interface and for now especially when the average computer
 user still cant type more than maybe wpm nl is a painfully slow
 clunky interface
yes  true true


 put it this way would you login wake the bot and ask for the seattle
 weather or would you do as we all do and just click the weather
 icon sitting there on your desktop
what about a situation where you dont directly asktalk to the bot but
they listen in and advisecorrectinterjectetc
example two people discussing trips etc may trigger a weather bot to
mention what the forecast says  without directly being asked
