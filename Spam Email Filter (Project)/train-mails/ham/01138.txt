	ill have to try it with another window manager and see if i can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries i dont have this
problem with any other windows though just the exmhunseen window


how about enabling the show unseen message count in folder cache
option it displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
if greater than  so you dont really need the unseen window unless
youre using more sequences than just unseen
