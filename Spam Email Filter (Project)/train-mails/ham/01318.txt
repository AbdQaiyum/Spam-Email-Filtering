 trouble is you dont necessarily know ahead of time whos 
 wanting to send
 you stuff  i dont have your pgp public key on my keychain  
 you can do all
 the signing you want its not going to help  however if you 
 stick a habeas
 header in your mail i can hopefully be reasonably sure that 
 youre not
 trying to spam me  it is going to be all about enforcement 
 though well
 have to see how they do on enforcement

  signing messages to someone s public key isnt impossible 
 using some
 creative scripting you could even do it with openpgpcompatible 
 software
