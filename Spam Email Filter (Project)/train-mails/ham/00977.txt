 is there a way to do a global sort command heres the situation
 i like to sort by date every folder im cleaning up my inbox from
 most recent to oldest since i find this direction most efficient i
 guess because it helps me recognize the significance of individual
 old messages but this adds messages to my other folders in the
 wrong order when im done id like to resort all the folders ive
 changed

i dont understand  how does sorting one folder add messages to
other folders  what do you use to sort
