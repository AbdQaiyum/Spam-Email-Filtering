this feature excerpted from wolfgang engels shaderx book from wordware 
publishing presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a noninteger power function the technique works for input 
values between  and  and supports large exponents the presented shader does 
not require any texture lookup and is scalable making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents
