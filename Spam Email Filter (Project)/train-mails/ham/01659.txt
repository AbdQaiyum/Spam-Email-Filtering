 the other thing on my todo list probably tonights tram ride home is
 to add all headers from nontext parts of multipart messages if nothing
 else itll pick up most virus email real quick

see the checkin comments for timtestpy last night  adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate

def crackcontentxyzmsg
    x  msggettype
    if x is not none
        yield contenttype  xlower

    x  msggetparamtype
    if x is not none
        yield contenttypetype  xlower

    for x in msggetcharsetsnone
        if x is not none
            yield charset  xlower

    x  msggetcontentdisposition
    if x is not none
        yield contentdisposition  xlower

    fname  msggetfilename
    if fname is not none
        for x in fnamelowersplit
            for y in xsplit
                yield filename  y

    x  msggetcontenttransferencoding
    if x is not none
        yield contenttransferencoding  xlower




    t  
    for x in msgwalk
        for w in crackcontentxyzx
            yield t  w
        t  

i suspect most of that stuff didnt make any difference but i put it all
in as one blob so dont know which parts did and didnt help
