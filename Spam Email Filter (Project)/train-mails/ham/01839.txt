aaron swartz has written up a warchalking faq that addresses the shibboleths 
and paranoia about discovering marking and using wireless connectivity 

    is that illegal 

    although i am not a lawyer i dont think its illegal to make chalk marks 
    on the sidewalk i know a lot of hopscotch players whod be worried if it 
    was 

    well is it immoral 

    not at all warchalking is a helpful service to assist people in finding 
    something they need an internet connection  

link discuss
