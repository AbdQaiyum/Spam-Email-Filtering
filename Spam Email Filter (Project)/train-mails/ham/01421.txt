 another area for potentially fruitful study  its clear that the
 highestvalue indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam
 theres an actual reason for that  advertising has to strive
 to get your attention early  so for example if we only bothered to
 tokenize the first  of a msg would results get worse

 spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning
 of the message  in pratice that would probably work fine

note that timtestpys current tokenizer only looks at decoded text mime
sections or raw message text if no mime exists spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldnt even be looked at
except that the email package has to parse nontext parts well enough to
skip over them and tokens for the most interesting parts of contenttype
disposition transferencoding decorations are generated for all mime
sections

schemes that remain ignorant of mime are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of nice text in the preamble area after the headers and
before the first mime section which most mail readers dont display but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by grahams scoring
scheme

but i dont worry about clever spammers  ive seen no evidence that they
exist  wink  even if they do the open source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance and theres no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme  even if they did for the kind
of scheme were using here they cant know what nice text is not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one  at that point theyd be doing targeted
marketing and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously
