my typical javatoc conversion doesnt increase the lines of code by
more than  and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place  some things are substantially more succinct when written in c
than in java  c and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries  i personally dont use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though

on a tangent i find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
nontrivial api almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner  code reuse is wonderful and all that but
libraries frequently make design tradeoffs that wont work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what i need  unfortunately it isnt
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple api to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases  ive built
a small collection of flexible psuedopolymorphic apis over the years
that i tend to use but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it
