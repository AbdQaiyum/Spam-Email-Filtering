 i started wondering how does apt react when it finds a newer kernel in
 the bunch of to be updated files

it skips it see the etcaptaptconf file for this

 and has anyone ever tried to do a distupgrade say from  to  
 should it work if not why

ive done a distupgrade from  to a quite broken rawhide release it
was a mess still it went much faster and smoother than if i had done it
manually with rpm u or f i think that updates between stable releases
should still be done with the installer since iirc sometimes a few
twitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats it
should work though i still prefer backuping config files and
reinstalling a clean system when i have the time
