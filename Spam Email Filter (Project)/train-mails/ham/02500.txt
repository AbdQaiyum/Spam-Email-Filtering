hi

i think you need to give us a little more detailed information

 i have a prob when trying to install linux tried redhat suse on my
 laptop 

you get exactly the same problem with suse and redhat is that right
what versions of these have you used

 i can start the install but after about min the whole pc just
 dies

as in freezes reboots  do you get any errors

 i know its not a linux prob and here is what i have encountered
 
 i had the same problem when installing win on it and eventually sorted it
 out by disabling the infrared port 

did you disable it in the bios or in windows

 im guessing this might be same prob although im not sure i am very new
 to linux so its not that easy for me to work it out i did manage to
 follow the setup procedure at one stage using images on disks and it
 cuts out either as its trying to verify what cdrom i have or just after
 hence my suspicion of the infrared port again

 what laptop is it  what is the processor and how much ram does it have

 you cannot simply boot off the cdrom  it must be quite an old laptop
then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the bios  is the cdrom external
or strange in some way
