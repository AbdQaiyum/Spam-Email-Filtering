   tell me what keystroke made it happen so i can reproduce it and ill
   see what i can do about it or if i cant ill hand it off to brent

dont worry too much about it you seem to have plenty of other things
to do in the immediate future and this one isnt so critical that people
cant use the code in normal ways

but to make it happen type with normal key bindings any digit so the
code thinks youre trying a message number then backspace so the digit
goes away then  other junk characters dont seem to have the
problem i have just been playing   that will do it every time

that is  h 

once you get into that state the same traceback occurs for every
character you type until a message is selected with the mouse

this is looking like it might be easy to find and fix so ill take a
look at it later
