this is true of manatees also  you dont want to know

  

so how much of it is due to jumping the interspecies boundary for 
status  ie i can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species or i can  be ambitious and 
go after the authority figure in the room
the alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty and then of 
course theres the theyll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions hmmm is this a potential intelligence test 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response
