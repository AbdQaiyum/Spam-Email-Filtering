 clearly our nonsilly nonantiquated ideas about relationships have
 resulted in mostly shortduration relationships and singleparented
 dysfunctional kids not enough of them too boot so to keep our
 demographics from completely keeling over were importing them from places
 with mostly silly and antiquated ideas

 at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
 counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
 something wrong

there was a fascinating article in the economist  weeks back the issue
with a pregnantlooking statue of liberty on the front that stated that
even for the native us population fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half i think the current figure for the us is a little over  but
not quite the  of replacement rate combined with the very fertile
nonnative population the article implied the us was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions as well the
population would overall be more youthful with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs military spending consumer spending
etc

europe did not show the same increase in fertility

some actual data for the us are here
