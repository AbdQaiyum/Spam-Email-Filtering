 i would appreciate it if you could get gabber packages for red hat  i 
 will be making a new release soon but even in the meantime  
 packages would be ok
 
 i know that in the beta red hat was using a modified version of 
 gnomelibs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm if this is 
 still the case in  i can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work 
 again

im facing another problem right now it looks like libsigc is no longer
included in the distribution and gtkmm wont compile without it 
i guess ill have to repackage it myself for  assuming its possible
