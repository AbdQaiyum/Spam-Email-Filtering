i may be wrong but i think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality wouldnt
it

my version of msgchange not yet updated has a check

    if msgid   
	 allow null msgid from msgshowwhat which supplies line instead
	if msgid    return
     else 
    

at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single  case
perhaps the thing to do is for msgchange to validate a msgid as a
number before continuing

 you can also duplicate thiswith
 
 msgchange  noshow
 
 at the tcl prompt in the log window  i suspect that the sequence
 parser which understands things like  to mean messages  through 
 is confused when asked to addremove message  from a sequence
 
 if we are allowed to assume  or higher which we cant really then
 we could add
 
 if string is integer selectsel 
     bail out of message select mode
 
 to the selecttypein procedure
 
 we can probably survive with
 
 if regexp  selectsel 
     bail out of message select mode

      tell me what keystroke made it happen so i can reproduce it and ill
      see what i can do about it or if i cant ill hand it off to 
 brent
   
   dont worry too much about it you seem to have plenty of other things
   to do in the immediate future and this one isnt so critical that people
   cant use the code in normal ways
   
   but to make it happen type with normal key bindings any digit so the
   code thinks youre trying a message number then backspace so the digit
   goes away then  other junk characters dont seem to have the
   problem i have just been playing   that will do it every time
   
   that is  h 
   
   once you get into that state the same traceback occurs for every
   character you type until a message is selected with the mouse
   
   this is looking like it might be easy to find and fix so ill take a
   look at it later
