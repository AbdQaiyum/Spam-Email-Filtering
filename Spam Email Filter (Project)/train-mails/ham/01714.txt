  i also looked in more detail at some fps in my geeks traffic  the
  first ones a doozie thats the term right   it has lots of
  html clues that are apparently ignored
 
  the clues below are loaded with snippets unique to html like br

i meant to say that they were  clues cancelled out by 
clues  but thats wrong too  it looks i havent grokked this part of
your code yet this one has way more than  clues and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more  than  clues
and no others made it into the list  i thought it was looking for
clues with values in between apparently it found none that werent
exactly 

 that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues

this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few
similar ones  i wonder if theres anything we can learn from looking
at the clues and the html  it was heavily markedup html with ads in
the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and
soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including
zope and zeo

 that there are any  clues in here means the scheme ran out of
 anything interesting to look at  adding in more header lines should
 cure that

are there any minablebutunmined header lines in your corpus left
or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there

  the seventh was similar
 
  i scanned a bunch more until i got bored and most of them were either
  of the first form brief text with url followed by quoted html from
  website
 
 if those were textplain the html tags should have been stripped  im
 still confused about this part

no sorry  these were all of the following structure

  multipartmixed
      textplain        brief text plus urls
      texthtml         long html copied from website

i guess you get this when you click on mail this page in some
browsers

 that html tags arent getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me

still

 this seems confused jeremy didnt use my trained classifier pickle
 he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora
 thats an entirely different kind of experiment from the one youre
 trying indeed youre the only one so far to report results from
 trying my pickle on their own email and i never expected that to
 work well its a much bigger mystery to me why jeremy got such
 relatively worse results from training his own  and hes the only
 one so far to report results from that experiment

i think its still corpus size
