 hey i have a problem
 i have a rpms that i have installed that i want to uninstall i do it
 like so
 rpm e rpm package
 and it gives the error package not installed so i install it like
 so
its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm ivh packagenamerpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm e packagename   ie rpm e sendmail or 
rpm e sendmaildevel 

give that a go and it should work np

 rpm i rpm package
 and it gives the error package already installed so i force it to
 install like so
 rpm i force rpm package
 this installs it and then i try to uninstall it again and it still
 gives me the same error package not installed
  
 how can i get it to recognize that the package is indeed installed it
 andor get it to unstall it
  
 thanx in advance
