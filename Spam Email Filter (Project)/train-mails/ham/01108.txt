  hi all
  
  ill be leaving this evening until next monday with no access to
  whatsoever to a single computer until then woohoo real holidays 
 
 i dont think i could take it the network was down for an hour here and
 i was climbing the walls 

i cant stand it either when its at work or home and id planned on doing
something that required network access but i really feel like i need a
break now away from work pressure that almost drove me nuts all summer
ah the joys of responsibilities 

six days without computers ahead but six days driving my  bandit
roadster bike i wont be miserable nor get bored dont worry for me 
i also have the first lord of the rings book to finish half way through
now and the two others to read lots of sane and nonwired occupations
ahead
oh did i mention beer drinking with friends 

matthias really happy to be on holidayyyy for the first time this year
