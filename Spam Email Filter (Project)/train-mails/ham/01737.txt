   first test results using tokenizertokenizertokenizeheaders
   unmodified    second test results using
   mboxtestmytokenizertokenizeheaders  this uses all headers
   except received data and xfrom  

  tp try the latter again but call the base tokenizeheaders too

sorry  i havent found the time to try any more test runs  perhaps
later today
