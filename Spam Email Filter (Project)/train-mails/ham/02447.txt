raymond l wallace 
bigfoot story teller


ray wallace a controversial figure involved in  years of bigfootrelated
events died november   in toledo washington  the washington state
construction tycoon had been ill for some time living in a toledo rest
home

it was at bluff creek california in  which found ray wallaces
company building a new road through the northern california forest   in
august through october wallace construction companys employee jerry crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot  thanks to instructions from
taxidermist bob titmus crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called bigfoot  crew
took the cast to town to quiet local ridicule and showed it to a humboldt
county newspaper editor  the photograph of jerry crew with the giant
plaster of paris foot imprint went out over the newswires   it produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of sasquatch to todays
global awareness of bigfoot soon after the publicized crew finds wallace
and his brother claimed other bigfoot activity around the construction site
wallace said he found tracks and droppings of bigfoot

wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life  allegedly in the later in the s for example wallace
offered to sell texas millionaire tom slick a captured bigfoot  wallace
failed to produce the creature when slick came up with an offer down
through the years wallace would carry on pranks be tied to carved fake
sasquatch feet and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films
he was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold  after awhile most bigfoot hunters and
researchers took wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales through
his contributions to strange magazine the track record and indirectly to
fate magazine wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
bigfoot mystery

in march  ray wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby bigfoot  saying he had tracked bigfoot for
forty years wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young sasquatch to
adulthood wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby bigfoot with
care and respect and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch  no one
came forth with a baby bigfoot

ray wallace added an intriguing mostly harmless storytelling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of bigfoot that various friends of his
such as ray crowe director of the international bigfoot society enjoyed

ray wallace was interred at the lone hill cemetery in toledo washington
state on november
