  how about configuring sa to set precendence to low for spam
  messages then filter on that  no real human ive ever seen has
  actually set precendence to low on real mail

 assuming there isnt a better way for lotus notes users we could
 create a precedence spam convention  the only two precedence
 headers ive seen aside from one or two odd messages are bulk and
 list  adding a spam header makes sense given the convention

id suggest using precedence junk albeit its no standard header does most 
software already recognize it courier eg doesnt send autoreplies to 
mails with the precedence bulk or junk i think outlook does handle these 
special too  says
 autoresponses should always contain the header
          precedence junk
 notice the spelling of precedence in particular count the number of
 ns and as and ses if youre totally agraphic andor from the united
 states this will prevent welltempered mail programs from generating
 bounce messages for these if the recipient cant be reached the
 autoresponder message is simply discarded 
 
 for what its worth the meaning of the precedence header in practice is
 that it affects sendmail so that messages identified as less important get
 moved back in the queue under high load
