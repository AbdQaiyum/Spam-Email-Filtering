 seems like a good idea  we might get one of two other issues 
 raised tomorrow too once us people get back to work tomorrow and 
 start downloading  in earnest

yep i reckon thats likely

btw im hearing reports about problems resolving spamassassinorg
anyone else noticing this  if its serious ill see if i can get
mark reynolds to add a ndary in the us to go with the primaries
in oz

      looks like there may be a razor issue

i think this is a razor bugglitch triggered when file permissions
dont allow its own log system to work  at least thats the report
i heard on the razor list in the past

theo does it work now that you devnulld the logfile

      version number says cvs
      tag tree as rel this time too

i wont bother tagging with rel imo i dont think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code so ive just
put a line in mailspamassassinpm instead   i will of course
tag with a release label though
