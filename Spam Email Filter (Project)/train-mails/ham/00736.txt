sorry i just had a runin with a neighbor whom ive never met before who
pigeonholed me within one minute after i asked a question  he said are you
one of them environmentalists for some reason that narrowminded attitude
of not listening to what i was saying and categorizing me into a box in his
little paranoid republican fantasy world just pissed me off

sheesh ive been out of work too long
