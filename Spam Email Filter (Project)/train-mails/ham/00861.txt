  the first computer to crack enigma was optical
 bletchley park used optical sensors which were and
still are the best way to read paper tape at high speed
you can read about it in the standard accounts eg
   httpwwwpicotechcomapplicationscolossushtml

but colossus was not for enigma the bombes used for enigma were
electromechanical im not aware of any application of optical techniques
to enigma unless they were done in the us and are still classified and
clearly the first bulk breaks of enigma were done by the bombes so i
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not whether this
statement has any credibility at all
