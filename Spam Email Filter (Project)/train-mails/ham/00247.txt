 hitlerstyle applicant welcomed by parties
 by roger boyes
 
 
 
 managers of germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from mein kampf hitlers personal manifesto the incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the fhrer 
 
 edmund stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading germany than the
 present chancellor said one letter sent to the christian social union
 headquarters in ingolstadt chancellor schrder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our fatherland said the letter
 signed by a certain rudolph lewald 
 
 the csu immediately spotted a potential member many thanks for your nice
 thoughts replied the local party manager who enclosed an application for
 membership 
 
 the letter used chunks of hitlers book which is still banned in germany
 history students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries
 
 
 the strongest the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive
 the letterwriter said socalled humanity is melting like snow in the march
 sun such phrases were lifted from mein kampf which was written while hitler
 was in jail after the failed munich putsch of  
 
 similar letters also using the nazi leaders words were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses i read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure the manager of the christian democratic union in
 cologne said 
 
 great that you want to join us enthused the green party headquarters the
 free democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which hans dietrich genscher the former foreign minister would be the
 star guest the social democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 gerhard schrder the chancellor 
 
 i wanted to test how serious parties are about combating rightwing
 extremism said the letterwriter who was in fact the cologne novelist
 rainer popp i had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic 
 
 for the first few days i expected two men in leather coats from the special
 branch to knock on my door instead only the postman called  with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters herr popp said 
 
 i was stunned that political parties could react in this way  i reckon i
 would have had the same response if i had signed the letter adolf hitler
