subject event notification uunet north american backbone problems
 pdt tix fwd


hello

i have just spoken with an uunet technician at  pdt and he was unable
to provide me with any new information regarding the outage  he did
confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
nationwide through out their network  they are currently working with
their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue

a large number of internaps connections to uunet remain shutdown and
traffic is being routed over alternate providers  the scale of this
outage is causing a large number of peering points with uunet and other
providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts

if you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
nocinternapcom containing a traceroute and sourcedestination ip
addresses and we will investigate  if it is possible will will attempt to
move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an internap pnap
if that will provide better performance

regards
andrew
