the pays not good  a year but there is insurance a  i 
think off a student loan or for future education and noncompete status 
for any govt job after a years service  i moved to new orleans 
yesterday and i should be flying to dc in about a month to start the 
americorps training  ill be setting up a community technology center which 
will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks just 
like learning ms shit yeah yeah wtf am i doing  i know  so that 
they can possibly find better jobs  im sure ill be doing all sorts 
of other things too like helping folks with their taxes writing grants 
etc  the website is wwwamericorpsorg  there are all sorts of jobs 
all over the country so if someone out there can survive on the small 
salary its something she might want to take a look at  

since xi is in college and getting grants  scholarship  child support 
from dad my load has gone down terrifically  the irs is after me for 
money i didnt make on the stock market so its a way to at least get 
into a situation where they will have to understand that yes they will 
have to wait  

but bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
you do this type of job  im up for some of that
