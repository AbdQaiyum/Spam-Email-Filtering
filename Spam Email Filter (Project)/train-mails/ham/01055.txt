 if i can use apt can i use it to get updates from these  different places
  the null update redhat upgrades
  the null files at freshrpmsnet
  the regular rh files from freshrpmsnet

you could build your own aptrepository just mirror the needed directories
eg by using a wget cron job symlink the needed rpms and recreate the
repository it is already worth the trouble if you have more than one
installation

in any case in order to acces the mentioned places somebody must keep such a
repository up to date be it yourself or someone else
