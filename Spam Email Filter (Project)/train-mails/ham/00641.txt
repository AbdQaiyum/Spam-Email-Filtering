heh ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not 
parroting the party line

it was even less so thirty years ago my story remains the same take it 
or leave it ive said the same words to white supremacists as to 
suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to french irish etc etc

i dont have to agree with anything you say i am obligated to defend 
to the death your right to say it i dont give a rats ass where you 
say it even in france i dont care where the political pendulum has 
swung currently

 probably because we have this pesky st amendment thing here still
 lots of us in the states have developed a disturbing tendency to shout
 down or in recent years shackle in legal bs opinions thoughts and
 individual behaviors we dont agree with


 except that parroting the party line doesnt really require much
 freedom of speech now if you had posted something from a left of
 center source you would have been shouted down in flames buried in
 ad hominem attacks and probably get your name added to an fbi list


 besides the basic rule in the united states now is ill defend your
 rights to say anything you want but if it isnt appropriately
 neoconish well dont expect to work

 that were coming to conclusions at odds with the presidents views and
 in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices
