 i actually like neales xspamdisposition header i just wonder if maybe we
 should choose something with a different prefix than xspam so that
 people dont confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with
 that prefix

i think its fine in general just so long as noone checks in anything
that puts it into my test corpus

or alternately whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer 
i know my mail host interlink runs sa but i also run it with my own
set of rules and scores i dont want my spamfilter to be getting messed
up by an upstream spam filter
