 funny enough that also happened to a friend of mine who uses both the
 web interface and a pop client last time i tried to send a picture
 which was around k it got denied saying that quota was exceeded
 when he looked at his account on the web it mentionned  mb free so i
 have no idea what theyre playing at 
 
 doesnt really help but just wanted to confirm the problem

  is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmaileircomnet
  
  ive been reading the emails using the web based interface but ive
  reached my quota limit there doesnt seem to be any way to get the
  emails off the server i can connect to the account using pop but that
  only retrieves unread emails theres also no way to mark emails as
  unread from the html interface
  
  is there a way i can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
  the emails and remove them off the server
  
  its been years since ive used fetchmail i dont recall be able to do
  this
  
  any other suggestions welcome theres a few hundred email so i dont
  fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account
