this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c then c and
moved on to java and i think that

looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive yours is
anecdotal they dont know what theyre talking about

well i sure dont claim that i think most people on fork probably have
more programming knowledge than i do theres lots of experience out
here

  the people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programming
language you write things in they just want it to work
robert harley wrote
in my experience they do care  it has to work certainly and in
particular it has to work with what theyve already got and it has to
work on clients systems
my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on
linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and havent come back yet

well i think until recently support for most things on linux was kind of
shady things have got much better youre right in that the jdk used to
suck on linux but then imho linux is still maturing or at least
development tools for linux are maturing ive been developing a few
server side apps that run on linux recently with jdk x and theyve had
no problems with great performance

robert harley worte
microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows
they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a
service pack  somehow i cant imagine them removing the ability to
run c programs

hmmm do you really think that ms is pulling out java because its a bad
programming language or application platform  you dont think this has
anything to do with net being a competitor to java do you  or that ms has
basically copied java with some additional features and called it c
isnt that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the
right way to go for most high level applications

reza bfar wrote
  c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again
robert harley wrote
cant say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
issues apart from the fact that i frequently need   gb

hmmm again youre telling me that youve never had a nasty bug that took
you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak  i am
not the best cc programmer not even close but ive known really
good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory
management however occasional they may be

its about design patterns architecture high level stuff
robert harley wrote
if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve
then its trivial anyway irrespective of language

wow  so youre telling me that unless the application involves
bitcounting its trivial  what about the application itself  what about
high level problems such as task distribution workflow etc  arent most
high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns
or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal cc code  for
example do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks
there are lots of them on this list are working on writing an operating
system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment

i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low
level problems that have been solved  million times over and over
and over again
robert harley wrote
you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time
on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont  depends
entirely on the programmer not the language

i can see how you could infer this however what i believe to really be the
case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large
applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more
than three programmers  in those cases its always very hard to get the
programmers to agree on apis memory management techniques etc  with
java the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you dont sit around in
a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database
jdbc or a messaging bus jms


  java is not just a programming language its also a platform
robert harley wrote
buzzword

yikes  have you written db code with cc for different databases just an
example  tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix  say you
have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql
bad ideabut for the sake of the example would you rather deal with
jdbc port or cc port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use
odbc


a monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicing
and dicing the same problems  different ways
robert harley wrote
unsupported assertion

so are you saying that there is a standard set of apis for cc for
everything aside to the minimal ansi stuff  is there a standard way of
dealing with cc applications for various domain problems messaging
database persistence etc that rivals java  id like to know if there is
one accepted by everyone who writes cc in that case i claim
ignorance

not suggesting that java is the golden hammer just that cc is
overkill for most things i even coded in vb but vb is a true disgrace
to programming its just lame java is object oriented no
flamemail from the antioo people please that is a religious
discussion and relatively clean and i dont think that every kid
can write a well designed java program  kids typically dont understand
various design patterns and principles to my experience they actually
tend to think more of the low level problems wanting to rewrite and
reinvent the world a tendency that is much more possible imho in cc
than in java due to existence of standard apis
