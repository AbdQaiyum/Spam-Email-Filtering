  if guys still have silly antequated ideas about womens role then
  their opportunities for finding women will be scarce  
 
 what is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in

it also depends on what the fad is or what is in style  

 i dont have statistics on the love half life but it seems longterm 
 relationships use something else for glue
 
 clearly our nonsilly nonantiquated ideas about relationships have
 resulted in mostly shortduration relationships and singleparented
 dysfunctional kids not enough of them too boot so to keep our
 demographics from completely keeling over were importing them from places
 with mostly silly and antiquated ideas

actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have 
resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page and musical  instrumnet 
and canvas  whats the problem if we dash a little mrs dash on them    
or cayenne  or ginger mm ask me about ginger root play  

and let me tell you this just because a child happens to be 
singleparented what a word does not mean that child is dysfunctional 
or lives in a dysfunctional home  the govtmediachurch has tried to make 
it look like there is a disintegration when in fact there is a coming 
together of other family members and friends to raise children  its not 
decaying  its changing  nothing wrong with change


 at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
 counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
 something wrong
 
 maybe we should really go dirty tleilaxu all the way
 

maybe yall should buy mw some more bandwidth
