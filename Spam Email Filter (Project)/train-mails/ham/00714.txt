and say hello to the cool  oooo  this is going to cause some stir 

of course not  some people just dont want to be confused by the facts


summary

as part of an ongoing nasauah joint project dr john christy of uah
and dr roy spencer of nasas marshall space flight center use data
gathered by microwave sounding units msus on national oceanic and
atmospheric administration tirosn satellites to get accurate direct
measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the
earth 

but some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
predicting global warming and storms and floods in  years even
though it cant predict next weeks weather  and predict widespread
cooling in some parts of the globe which is now part of global
warming  and will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
scaremonghhhhhhhhh proof



globally however the satellite data show a cooling trend of 
degrees celsius per decade since the first noaa tirosn satellites
went into service

umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations when
even detectable in the noise go either way depending on which data
you look at


of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way
readings are taken  the construction of
nearby roads parking lots runways and buildings may cause the
temperature to rise a little due of urbanization this temperature
change may be an artifact of a local asphalt effect rather than a
longterm widespread climate change

one study from vienna showed longterm warming from thermometers at
the airport and none from other sites  another study with data from
antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew
i may have mentioned this one b
