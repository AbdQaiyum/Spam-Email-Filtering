i run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops gratis
ssh x forwarding  in fact your message was read and replied to
this message while at work using an exmh instance running on my home
machine

so you have  copies  per desktop of exmh running

thats what i usually do but what id really like would be some 
 automagism to tell them flist rescan folder which i now do 
 manually whenever im going to work at the other machine

cheers
