dq before we release itd be great if someone could test a few
dq additional score ranges  maybe we can lower fps a bit more  

i dont think theres much more room for lowering fps left which the ga can 
achieve  remember also that the awl will reduce fps but its effects arent 
factored in to the ga scores

the work currently being done on the ga and comparing different methods of 
doing the scoresetting is very worthwhile and extremely useful however we 
really ought to get a release out since  is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on

the fpfn rate of  with pretty well any scoresetting mechanism will be 
better than   we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
 or  branches

dq something like
dq 
dq   for low   low   low  
dq     for high   high   high  
dq       evolve

you could just allow low and high to be evolved by the ga within ranges id 
be enormously surprised if it didnt end up with low and high since 
thatd give the ga the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores  the 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization but rather one of 
humanbased concern that individual scores larger than about  are dangerous 
and liable to generate fps and individual scores less than  are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate fns

dq maybe even add a nybias loop

adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile  changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation functions idea of what the fpfn ratio should be

dq  afaik theres nothing major hanging out waiting to be checked in 
dq  on b is there
dq 
dq nope

great

dq  ill be on im most of today tomorrow and monday while cranking
