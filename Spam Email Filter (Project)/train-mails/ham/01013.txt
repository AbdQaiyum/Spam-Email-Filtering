   i can cutnpaste from exmhs message display window into spawned
   gvim processes but not into anything else

thats odd  i cut  paste between all kinds of windows exmh into
mozilla xterm another wish script of mine i use for dns tasks but
that one i guess is to be expected netscape when i used to use it
but i suppose it and mozilla are the same codebase approx  in fact
i cant thing of anything it fails for that i have noticed

what is an example of an anything else that it fails for for you
