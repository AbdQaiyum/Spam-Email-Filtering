over on arstechnica wwwarstechnicacom i saw mention of a wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways apple is showing its love and
respect for its users

httpwwwwiredcomnewsmachtml

there is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
httparstechnicacomreviewsqmacosxmacosxhtml

true to form industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications apples private menu extras apis were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect the architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras third
party or otherwise was in development

all of that changed with the release of jaguarbut not because the
private apis had changed if they had third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new apis as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private apis in the first
place

but what actually happened in jaguar was that apple added code to forcibly
exclude all nonapple menu extras other parts of the api did not change
but when a menu extra is loaded it is compared to a hardcoded list of
known menu extras from apple if the menu extra is not on that list it
is not allowed to load

its easy to laugh at steve ballmers sweatsoaked gyrations as he chants
developers developers developers but microsoft clearly understands
something that apple is still struggling with it is in a platform
vendors best interest to encourage development for its platform in
apples case this doesnt mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and ui element pluggable via public
apis thats clearly a lot of work and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an os in its infancy and in the meantime if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in unsupported ways then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions

but for apple to go out of its wayto actually expend developer
effortto stop these third party developers while still failing to
provide a supported alternative is incredibly foolish
