  daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself
  on your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to
  only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all
  violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will
  quickly remove us from the next release  but youre trying to kill
  habeas before it has a chance to show any promise
 
 i think ive worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a
 score  im just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle
 for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base

i have to agree here  if habeas is going to die just because sa does not
support it thats a serious problem with the business model but that is
nobodys problem but habeass

a possible solution is for habeass business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of sa to give it the benefit of the doubt  i have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill

 i dont see a problem supporting it in spamassassin  but i see dans
 points
 
    high score as far as i can see thats because spamassassin is
     assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days and the
     habeas mark has to bring it down below that    imo we have to fix
     the highscorers anyway  no spam ever needs to score over  in our
     scoring system   tagged anyway

this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion but amavisd in all
its incarnations and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject
at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold often   
if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 
thered better be zero fps because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to

 but i agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that
 frequently hit on newsletters if any newsletters actually use the habeas
 mark that will be one way to help

newsletters wont use the mark  habeas is priced way too high  a factor
of at least  over what the market will bear imo  on a permessage
basis for most typical mailing lists lockergnome say to afford it

 habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle
 spam it seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to
  or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for
 copyright infringement

sorry that just cant work

if the habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in nonspam
and effectivelyenforced enough to be absent from spam such that eg
sa could assign a positive score to messages that do not have it then
spammers are out of business and habeas has no one to sue  theres nobody
left to charge except the people who want or are forced against their
will because their mail wont get through otherwise to use the mark

conversely if there are enough spammers forging the mark for habeas to
make all its income suing them then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed

either way it seems to me that after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of ceaseanddesist letters to clueless mompops
then either a theyre out of business b they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders or c theyve both
created and monopolized a market for internet postage stamps that
everybody has to pay them for

the latter would be quite a coup if they  could pull it off  they do
absolutely nothing useful unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet  effectively well be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them  i dont believe theyll
ever get that far but i dont particularly want to help them make it

 and i use the term they loosely because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point
