  ummm has somebody noticed that spamassassinsightings is the fourth most
  active list for this month on  there is more sighting than talk and
  devel together 

hmmm  do people know that they should only send false negatives there
either theres a lot of stuff sa is missing or some people are just
sending all their spam there

ive sent in some spam that either didnt score or scored practically 
nothing like below   i figure that most people run at  so if it 
scores less than that a rule needs to be honed to catch it
