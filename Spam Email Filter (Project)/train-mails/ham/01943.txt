daniel berlinger has noticed that mac software shops are starting to move to 
os xonly development this makes sense for two reasons first most people 
who pay for software have new computers so while os x may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets second if os x isnt successful the mac is 
over its not like system  is getting any more popular 

then again there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the macintosh developing for the mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site that only works on 
netscape given the market share of macs about  and the market share 
of netscape about  that is not a silly comparison 

robb beal wrote try this test go to a venture firm angel or big company 
with a mac os x productconceptprototype do they consider the fact that its 
a mac application a net plus no well duh your product would have to 
appeal to  times more mac users as a percentage than windows users just 
to break even in other words if your windows product appeals to  in  
windows users you have to appeal to  in  mac users to make the same 
amount of money 

now you may want to make an emotional appeal to developing for the mac 
thats fine if you like macs and youre doing it for fun more power to ya 

but as long as were talking investment you have to tell me why youre going 
to get  times as many users maybe theres less competition in your category 
on the mac maybe youre in a niche like graphics where it seems like macs 
dominate they dont it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big american cities use macs maybe your product cant sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere but if you want to make an investment 
in mac software be prepared to demonstrate how youre going to overcome that 
magic  multiplier
