    richie as i understand it postx versions of the core bsddb code
    richie ship under the sleepycat license which demands that projects
    richie using it must be publishedsource  

dont use bsddb in a closedsource product  use dbm or dumdbm or use
pickles or roll your own thang  i doubt the presence of bsddb would be the
only barrier to creating a closedsource product based upon the spambayes
code
