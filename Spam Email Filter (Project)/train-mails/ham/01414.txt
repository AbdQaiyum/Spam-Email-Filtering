 software vendors have been trying since forever to prevent software piracy
 remember when you had to enter a specific word from a specific page of the
 software manual which was printed on dark maroon paper so that it could
 not be photocopied  didnt work  propritery encoding of dvds  didnt
 work software that required the use of a registration key  didnt work 
 windows xp was shipped with this supposedly revolutionary method for
 stopping piracy and what happened  how long was it before the code was
 cracked how many keygens are there for windows xp  is someone running a
 pirated version of xp really going to use windows update to installed a
 service pack which breaks their os  just because m didnt include the
 change in their readme  fat chance

my problem is not the same as mss one i dont have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same cd with propably millions of working keys  each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay  the key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable  if the end users are teenagers 
youll face a huge wall when asking to be  of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly

i agree with all of you that mass production cds will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur  that can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration

btw thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight  im playing with 
gdbs dissassembler now but i dont think its what a typical cracker would 
use  any hints on unix cracking tools 

thanks
