 all freshrpmsnet is now set for the imminent release of red hat linux 

thanks a lot for all your effords it is just great

 ill probably post to the list once i open up ftpfreshrpmsnet so you can
 be the first ones to get in and download although i doubt youll have
 trouble finding access to at least one fast mirror using my mirror list

you mean the mirror list for rh or do there exist mirrors for your apt
repo
