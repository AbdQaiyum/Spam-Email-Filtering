 my experience has been that if the item is showing in xclipboard
 and is highlighted that is what is pasted using the mouse

classic x copyandpaste behavior is that you can only paste what is
currently highlighted  in fact it is the act of highlighting a
selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer  x has
no copy command  if you highlighted it you just copied it

 this does not seem to override what is in an applications own
 paste buffer as far as i can tell maples cut and paste for
 example is isolated

if ab application has a copy command that you can choose to use
separately from the process of highlighting something that command
is something the application authors wrote on their own  and it it
likely that an application that wrote an internal copy command would
also have their own customized paste command to make sure the two
work together  whether the internal custom select and paste
functions interoperate with the x servers global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program because in each case you
are relying on the programs authors efforts to blend separate systems
