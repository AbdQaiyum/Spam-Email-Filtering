 i has just been given an old toshiba cs with earliest pentium and mb
 of hd but only a floppy drive on it its got win which is funny to see
 again but gonna be cleared as soon as i stop messing with it what i was
 wondering was could anyone advise what os would be good for this i want a
 small usable nix distro for it that i can transfer to it fom floppy
 connecting this to winblowsi know that winblows allows piertopier
 connections over serial and parellel ports to other winblows but is this
 easy do for connecting winblows to nix

have done exactly this with debian only i used a pcmcia network card and
did it off ftpesatnet ucd bandwidth is rather good

however if youve another machine look into this null modem cable jobby

httprosebudspsqueensucaeddtcshtml

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionive no idea  you
could however put the files onto windows boot onto a ilug bbctm and
mount the fat partition

easierquicker way is to get your hands on a pcmcia nic  also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run
