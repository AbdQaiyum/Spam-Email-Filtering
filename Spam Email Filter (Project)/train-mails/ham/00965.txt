     so ill probably poke around at the sequences performance issues
  
  well theres this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand 
  
       hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that dont exist
      foreach m rseq 
          if file exists mhprofilepathfolderm 
              exmhdebug mhprofilepathfolderm not found
              set ix lsearch seq m
              set seq lreplace seq ix ix
           else 
               real hack

at least im upfront about my hacks 

              break
          
      
  
  which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
  of messages that dont exist   im not sure why it is important that the
  first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any
  of the others but im sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots
  and i dont know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the
  sequences it is looking at all the time

that was my thinking  my recollection about the first message being valid
is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting
for example or you are selecting a message to display

  it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
  folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
  directory   does tcl have a directory read function   i assume so

glob nocomplain mhprofilepathfolder 
will return an unsorted list of the directorys contents
but the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun
exmh already maintains incore lists of messages in sequences which is
already pretty tricky

  mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the
  context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called

in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify time
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp you could just read them again  also now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view that file will change
every time  in the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder
