 my sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to 
 escape lines begining with from   exmh  doesnt do this  should 
 it  it appears that my mh is mh   does nmh fix this

actually this issue used to escalate into a religious war the from  
envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format and from that 
perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in
mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with 
from  on the other hand this breaks the assumption that the mail 
transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body 
alone
things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message 
body

also strictly speaking the mbox format envelope or for us oldtimers 
the uucp envelope isnt just any line beginning with from  its really 
from a single space a valid email address two spaces and a valid 
date
for example

    from ptardifnbnetnbca  sun jul
