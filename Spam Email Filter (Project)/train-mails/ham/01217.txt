  as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas
  or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc
  and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll
  probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system 

    yeah i need to work this out too i just learned my lesson about living on the bleeding edge lesson learned  no more ximian under any circumstances  man that was annoying

    anyway i have returned to redhat  on my root filesystem saved my home directories music and games on other partitions and while i have the  stuff in the list everything i want to upgrade requires  rpms

    im not opposed to this but apt is  aptget distupgrade dumps core

    whats the inside secret here or do i just start searching mirrors for the iso and get over it
