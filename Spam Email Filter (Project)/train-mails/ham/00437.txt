 the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button but
 doesnt provide instantaneous feedback that the button was pushed instead
 requiring you to wait until the music starts  seconds this is a ui
 disaster since tatum doesnt get feedback right away she presses the
 button again thereby pausing the cd before it even plays shell only ever
 get music if she presses the button an odd number of times this happens a
 surprising amount of the time since she eventually hits the button again
 when the music doesnt play

nice to hear that somebody else does this too
