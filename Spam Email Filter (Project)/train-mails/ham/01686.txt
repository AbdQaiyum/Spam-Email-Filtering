 then i tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
 words in the header and emitted like this s s  hdr word
 that worked too well   the received and date headers helped the
 classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
 new

heh i hit the same problem but the other way round when i first
started playing with this  id collected spam for a week or two 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes

course it instantly picked up on received as a nonham 

curse that toosmartforme software still its probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software  when collecting
spamham make sure you try and collect from the same source
