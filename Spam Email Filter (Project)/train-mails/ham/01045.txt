  i guesshope some other people from the list will try it out 
 
  both problems you reported libasoundso and wrong xine dependency are now
  fixed in the current packages
 
  oh its maybe also worth pointing out  ive implemented at last sorting
  by both last change date and alphabetically for my build list in the php
  code  httpfreshrpmsnetbuilds
 
  and yes i accept patchescommentssuggestions about all those spec files

sure thing 

ive added to the spec some flags to remove oss and isapnp support at
build time if one wishes to so iss possible to do a

	rpmbuild recompile rpm without oss without isapnp

i havent included oss in my  because vt on my motherboard
is not supported  yet and im too lazy to recompile the kernel 

also having the kernel compiled by me i have no kernelsource package
installed  ive added a flag kernsrc that also can be used
without to remove the dependency for kernelsource at build time  it
would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
libmodulesuname rbuildincludelinuxh though however im
a beginner in rpm building  is it possible to buildrequire for a file
not provided by a package at all  ive googled a bit and found no way
to do that

i was also considering adding some sort of flag for the withcards
option in alsas configure but dont know how to do that  only found
out about without from your first alsadriverspec and existing rpm docs 
dont help much


oh and one more thing   at first ive installed the first version of
alsadriver for  although i dont have that kernel to supply
the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpms and compiled the modules
from source  it created the dev files and all

then wanted to make my own rpm for  so now im trying to rpmbuild
the alsakernel package  removed all alsa rpms and tried my spec

rpmbuild ba alsadriverspecmine without oss without isapnp
without kernsrc

but i get this

like i said im a beginned with rpm building so i dont understand
much of whats going on here  the macros file is from the makedev
rpm and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsadriver i think
   it is not in the filesystem anyway

ive looked in vartmpalsadriverrcroot they are there in
etc  for macros i think the part that does it is this line
in alsadriverspec

cp a sysconfdirmakedevdmacros buildrootsysconfdirmakedevd

and alsasound is installed by buildidrmakefile


oh and i think ive forgot to mention im running betanull
