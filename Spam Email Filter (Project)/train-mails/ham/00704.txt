 cool  i wasnt aware that the us had lifted its population out
 of poverty when did this happen i wonder where the media gets the
 idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening
   


 all the world loves a smartass

 

 seriously look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
 this continent before the europeans got here look at it now even
 for descendants of the original inhabitants even for the descendents
 of slaves who were brought here by force

 more stuff cheaper thats progress

 poverty of course is not relative its absolute disparity in
 wealth has nothing to do with it

 its like saying that groups have rights when in truth only
 individuals do like group rights disparity in wealth is
 statistical sophistry


 besides even if you cant help the distribution industrial wealth
 is almost always transitory and so is relative poverty even when
 there are no confiscatory deathtaxes the th anniversary forbes
  just came out and only a few tens of people are still there
 since  a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
 wealth income and inheritance than we do now more to the point
 theyre nowhere near the top
  

lovely quote from the forbes  list
and not a single astor vanderbilt or morgan rates a mention on the 
current forbes four hundred 

but you have to studiously ignore the  rockefellers  gettys  
hearsts  fords kelloggs wrigleys
and so on

there are more selfmade people on the list than i previously alluded to 
 i made a mistake most
of them seem to have ivy league educations or are ivy league dropouts 
suggesting to me that they werent
exactly poor to start with some of them have lovely selfmade stories
