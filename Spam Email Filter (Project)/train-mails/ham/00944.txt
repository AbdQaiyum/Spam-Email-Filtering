    interestingi dont think this was my bug
    it appears that msgchange was asked to change to message 
 
 something like that is quite possible but perviously typing nonsense
 in didnt cause tracebacks and now it does and the traceback came
 from the sequence code
 
 perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status
 line complaining about my lousy typing   thats probably what it
 should keep on doing the red part isnt important obviously

tell me what keystroke made it happen so i can reproduce it and ill see what 
i can do about it or if i cant ill hand it off to brent
