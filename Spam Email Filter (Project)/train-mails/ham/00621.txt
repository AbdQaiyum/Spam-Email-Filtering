    e you just cant tell important things from a picture and a few
    e words  its not how we are built  theres no geek code for
    e the heart and soul

nor is there a turing test even for someone with whom youve spent 
years boom bust and boom again and  children trust me there is
no magic litmus test other than the totally empirical try it and
see

string bags full of oranges
 and matters of the heart
 people laugh at anything
 and things just fall apart
  michael leunig

the only real test the only sensible test is to look back and
realize your relationship has lasted  years and see no reason to
believe it couldnt last another   in the absense of  years of
actual ahem handson experiential data a photo and a few words are
as good as any provided you are prepared for the dynamics of it

love is a verb  sex is a shared pursuit  there is no
relationship there is only the crew  sail away
