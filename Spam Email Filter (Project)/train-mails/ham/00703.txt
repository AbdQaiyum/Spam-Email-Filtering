    j better yet tell me where i should be listening for new music
    j now that pp is dead and i still cant pick up kfjc very well

how about your local pub

sorry couldnt resist

i still use live slowly the disconnected stations are returning
since the fee to stay on the air can be as low as month and if
your fave broadcaster wont pay youre given the option to pay for
them
