thats on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are
european and managed to free themselves for yapceurope or were they
on the contrary too busy in the big blue room  on the other hand the
number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level

davorg writes if you take a look at list of local groups on the
perl mongers web site youll see that its just got a good deal
shorter over the last month or so ive been making strenuous efforts to
contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still
active what you see is the result of this exercise almost half of the
groups have been removed because they havent responded to my emails

if your local group still exists but is no longer listed then that means
that i dont have an update to date contact for your group please let
me know if thats the case
