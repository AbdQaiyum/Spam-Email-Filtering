 political mail the snail kind doesnt bother me  i like it a lot of the
 time because as crap as it is at least its not the kind of info you get
 on tv  particularly for small time local politics its the best way to
 get information

except that thanks to the magic of spam its usually some elses locale

 but what matters is that mail is speech and political email has to be as
 well protected as any other political speech  spam is the tool for
 dissident news since the face that its unsolicited means that recipients
 cant be blamed for being on a mailing list

a terrible argument there are better technical solutions to privacy
protection than sending a copy of the same message to everyone on the
internet so the recipients cant be blamed for reading it

wait till phone spam is as cheap to send as email spam
