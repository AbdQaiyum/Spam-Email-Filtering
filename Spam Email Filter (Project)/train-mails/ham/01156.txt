hi

succeeded in ringing a bell anytime i get a mail
to my inbox not mailing lists spams etc by
using procmail to execute a play clinkwav on
the right mails
now my demands are growing 
i use my laptop remotely very often and now i would
like the bell to sound on that when i am there
i triedto use the kde remote sound server and it works in
the tests but when procmail runs it it doesnt presumably
as it doesnt have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop beeing another user

any hints

brgds
