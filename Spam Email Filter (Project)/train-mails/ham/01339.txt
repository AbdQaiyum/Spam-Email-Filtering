  tmdaers have you seen this before

 no but thanks for pointing it out

  id presume tmda is prior art but still it could be troublesome

 yup  tmdas core functionality was fully established before even the
 filing date

 anyone with experience in this area have a recommendation on whether
 this should be pursued or not

 if you think you can survive it please fight when i found that patent i
found others that were just common sense things that any geek could implement
with his scriptshelllanguage of choice and its time for someone to get the
medias attention on whats going on
 basically this is the new wave of namenappers it used to be domainnames
not its all the basic general ideas they can think offfind on the web that
theyre patenting
