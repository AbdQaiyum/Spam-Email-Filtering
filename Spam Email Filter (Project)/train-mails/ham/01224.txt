 when i went all open source i stopped using my old partioning app
 partition magic for the rh install i used fips a couple times
 then ext came out and my old commercial partioning app is real old so i
 ask what os software can nondestructively repartition a hd so i can put
 home on a seperate partition now

parted is your friend you cant do everything the most limiting being
that you cant move the start of a partition but its quite powerful
nevertheless and ive been very happy with it the few times ive had to
use it

 if you didnt put home on a separate partition
 
 with winbloze x i used to deltree the winbloze dir and some program
 files dirs and install fresh instead of upgrade while saving my
 other data can this trick be used with this rh upgrade example rpm e
 everything so all packages are gone hit reset button and boot to
 redhat cdrom in admin rescue mode delete all those config files left
 like etc then do an install but not format that single partition
 that im installing on if i can hack the details is this theory
 accurate or will rh want to destructively install and elimate all
 existing files

youre really better off backuping all placed where you know youve hand
edited or installed some files for me thats only etc root and
home then you reinstall cleanly formating  put your home files
back into place and youre ready to go
thats the moment i usually realize i had a nifty tweak to a file in
etcsysconfignetworkscripts or some special parameters added to an
etcmodulesconf entry so i look at my backup and make the same change
again the only thing where you can get stuck is the grubconf files
because although theres a etcgrubconf link its actually in
bootgrub so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save i have to pass pcibiosbiosirq for one of my
computers to work for example
