anyone heard of this law before

 q can i get a playlist
 a we are unable to offer a playlist the digital performance right in 
 sound recordings act of  passed by congress prevents us from 
 disclosing such information the digital law states that if one is 
 transmitting a digital signal song information cannot be 
 preannounced it is a music choice policy not to release a playlist of 
 upcoming or previously played songs

recently musicchoice upgraded their website with a very important 
service as far as im concerned realtime song info from their 
website my directv receiver is up on a shelf and its display scrolls 
intermittently and im surely not going to fire up my projector while 
listening to the radio so im quite happy that i can retrieve rt 
song info with urls like

httpbackstagemusicchoicecomsongidchannelssoundsoftheseasonsasp
httpbackstagemusicchoicecomsongidchannelsrapasp
httpbackstagemusicchoicecomsongidchannelsoperaasp
etc

now if i were a more eager hacker id write up little wsdl stubs for 
these event streams theyre clearly not worried about load since their 
own web pages specify  sec metarefresh and then feed em through a 
content router to alert me to cool songs heck crossreference the 
service to cddb and
