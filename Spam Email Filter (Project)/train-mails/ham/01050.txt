i wish i could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff
hooked up  so i so not know about it i have an excellent ess maestro which oss
supports pretty lame so i was forced to learn about alsa

i have used these commands to explore alsa and my chip

arecord l   list devices
arecord l   list pcm decices

i get some output like this

 arecord l
card  maestro ess allegro pci device  allegro allegro
  subdevices 
  subdevice  subdevice 

 arecord l
pcm list
 snip  craploads of output

i noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or
gamix have

for what it is worth here is what i have in modulesconf for my sound stuff

  alsa portion
 alias charmajor snd
  ossfree portion
 alias charmajor soundcore

  alsa portion
 alias sndcard sndmaestro
  ossfree portion
 alias soundslot sndcard

  ossfree portion  card 
 alias soundservice sndmixeross
  bad alias soundservice sndseqoss
 alias soundservice sndpcmoss
  bad alias soundservice sndseqoss
 alias soundservice sndpcmoss
 
  alsa options optional
 options snd sndmajor sndcardslimit snddevicemode
 options sndmaestro sndindex sndidmaestro sndampgpio
 
  oss options optional
 alias sndcard off
 alias sndcard off
 alias sndcard off
 alias soundslot off
 alias soundservice off

  preserve mixer settings
 postinstall usrsbinalsactl restore maestro
 preremove usrsbinalsactl store maestro
 postinstall usrsbinalsactl restore
 preremove usrsbinalsactl store

hope that helps good luck

hello

thanks for these rpms i removed the binary built from source targz
and installed your srpm of gamix  one quick question is there a way to
switch between digital out and analog out with the alsa driver and
utilities or for that matter with gamix  i know with the oss drivers
i was using it was as simple as emuconfig d for digital and
emuconfig a for analog with the emutools package for sblive  i
noticed there is sb live analogdigital output jack in alsamixer but
havent figured out the key to use if this is the right control in
mixer  also i tried to expand gamix to display all possible controls
but it defaults back to wave and music  with lfe center surround
and playback under wave this is how i control output of front and rear
speakers for digital outsurround and playback  under music
there are two controls but unresponsive  i have a tuner and cassette
deck hooked up to an audiovideo switch that goes into line in on the
soundcard  again with the oss drivers it was as simple as emuconfig
d and emuconfig a  digital out for anything coming from the
computer analog out for the tuner and cassette deck  i dont know if
this is necessary to switch inbetween to get line in to work or not
but an expansion of gamix would help where i could see all the
controls

any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks again for the gamix
rpms

kind regards

lance
