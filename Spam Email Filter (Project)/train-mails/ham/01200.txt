once upon a time hesty wrote 

 i know theyre all included in the freshrpms alsanull
 directory

now that psyche is released that directory was erased

 i was worried that with the new mplayerpre these
 packages might break something is there any mplayer
 package which includes all the options for vo and
 ao is that because alsa is not included in rh hence
 the lack of alsa option for mplayer from freshrpms
 or is there some swtiches to enable these options
 during 
 rpm build

for all my recent packages that support with and without options ive
put them in the description section see for instance 
httppsychefreshrpmsnetrpmhtmlid

where you can see 
available rpmbuild rebuild options 
with  alsa
without  aalib lirc libdv arts

the ogle package has also a with alsa option and ive had a bug report
about xine that i apparently unintentionally compiled with alsa directly


id like to aks this on the rpmzzzlist  would a new dependency of k the
alsalib package for many packages mplayer ogle xine be a problem for
the freshrpmsnet packages users as i really feel like blending alsa in
now especially since ive just spent some time recompiling alsakernel
package for all the psyche kernels
