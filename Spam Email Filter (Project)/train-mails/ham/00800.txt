    g so if crappy formsbased submission is the state of practice
    g for business enablement on the web i cant see this whole data
    g submission and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you
    g business process as working all that well

i love this business  if a bridge falls over the architect or the
engineer is in court the next day but when a software bridge falls
over we blame the air beneath it or the phase of the moon or
more often the people walking on it

   what idiots  dont they know youre supposed to walk on the
   balls of your feet not lead with your heels  didnt they read
   the blueprints  they were posted in the town hall  any idiot
   would know the hz heel cadence would pop rivets on the
   structural supports  geez pedestrians are so stupid

ours is the only industry that can hold itself  unresponsible
for any and all slothinflicted doom and the only industry which can
also get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned
to the media to investors to students and to each other

   god i hate telephones  telephones are stupid i used a telephone
   to like call my broker yesterday and yknow just after id
   ordered those  shares of nortel 

you just gotta love a massdelusion like that

although its like a total shock to  nines of all the
employed website designers out there the truth is webforms can
accept us of a as a country  incredible but true  web forms can
also accept multiple or even freeform telephone numbers and can
even be partitioned into manageable steps all this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the worlds
secondrichest corporation assuming cisco is still  and vendor
locking your business into their small transaction fee tithe

of course try and tell one of those niners that and theyll get all
defensive black list you as a sht disturber and undermine your
reputation with the boss  not that im speaking firsthand or
anything
