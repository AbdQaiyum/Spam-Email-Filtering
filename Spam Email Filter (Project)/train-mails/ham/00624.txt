 nor is there a turing test even for someone with whom youve spent 
 years boom bust and boom again and  children trust me there is
 no magic litmus test other than the totally empirical try it and

 the only real test the only sensible test is to look back and
 realize your relationship has lasted  years and see no reason to
 believe it couldnt last another   in the absense of  years of
 actual ahem handson experiential data a photo and a few words are
 as good as any provided you are prepared for the dynamics of it
 
 love is a verb  sex is a shared pursuit  there is no
 relationship there is only the crew  sail away
