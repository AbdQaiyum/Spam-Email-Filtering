im a very happy user of exmh but im paranoid also 
therefore im not too happy with exmh caching my pgp passphrases

usually i use a relatively secure tool called quintuple agent 
urlhttpwwwvibeattoolssecretagent to store my passphrases
and ive just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for such
external caches

the patch is attached it is against version  debian and the
files modified are extrasinittcl and pgpexectcl

ive added three new preferences in the general pgp section which
allow everybody to use hisher favourite external tool to get the
passphrase everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok

id be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff 
is worth to be added and does so apart from that im happy for 
suggestions comments or critique mind you im not exactly a special 
friend of tcl so my code may leave things to be desired

regards
az
