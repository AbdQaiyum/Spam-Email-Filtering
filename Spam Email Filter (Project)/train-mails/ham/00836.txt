 im not sure since i havent attended civics class
 in quite some time but the first amendment doesnt cover protected speech
 hate speech or actions 
 
 the first two are wrong the first amendment does
 protect speech the supreme court decides it protects
 duh and that happens to include most of what
 people consider hate speech unlike many other
 nations the us has no laws against hate speech per
 se and the first amendment is the reason for that
 


this was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status  i think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous  the point i keep trying to make
is that theres only two types speech and action 
i agree they are all speech and should be 
covered by the first amendment but

if hate speech is so protected why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it  theres
only two answers and one of them is wrong

   because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoevers offended at the time
   its because its not just speech but action
     a action whos consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person 

hate speech is mislabeled  its really threat  i think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as theres advantage
in being able to counterthreat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people they
dont like
