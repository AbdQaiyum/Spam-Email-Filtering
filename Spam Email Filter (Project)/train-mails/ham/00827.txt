 mf i dont think free speech is a license to speak directly at
 and be in the
 mf physical presence of any particular individual of your
 choosing  especially
 mf when that individual is busy doing something else and isnt
 interested

yep i agree 


 sure  and that goes back to my second argument  cohen   they can
 walk away   nobody compells them to stand there ill agree fully
 but we still have a constitutional right to speak out against
 policies actions and grievances

 again  if you want it another way lets change the constitution

huh  are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard
shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship if
shouting down public speakers is protected it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them every single time they open their mouth the tactic is stupid and
nonproductive and if generally used will only result in chaos  the tactic
is just stupid egobation at best unless the goal is to generate chaos
and humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up provided you can accurately identify them which is not
really possible anyway but hey this is my rant  imho
