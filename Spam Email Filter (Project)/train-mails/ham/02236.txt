we did a great panel on drm and the digital hub yesterday here at osxcon with 
tim oreilly victor nemachek from el gato makers of the eyetv digital tv 
recorder for the mac dan gillmor and jd lasica whos working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights glenn b networking news fleishman took great 
notes through the talk 

    dan tim youre a content or copyright holdertalk about these issues 

    obscurity can be a tool something like k books published in the us 
    most books are forgotten after publication ravening copying theft is 
    wrong most arent pirated publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months doesnt sell thats it and the 
    author has no rights publishers keeps rights til out of print etc 

    oblivion is fate of most books piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books people wouldnt pirate them in general because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators piracy is a marginal act it takes 
    away some of the cream 

    publishing wont go away but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher early on in the web the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher the way in which web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores 

    publishing is aggregation people will reemerge as publishers will 
    hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else 

    users are voting by their use of programs like kazaa eventually media 
    companies will adopt but if the changes are hardcoded into law then were 
    stuck for a long time with some mistakes
