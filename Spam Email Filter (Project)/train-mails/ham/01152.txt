 first when i try and run exmh with wish from tk it seems to take
 forever to start but with wish from tka it starts in a snap

this sounds like something piggy in the flist code  im seeing flist
in general taking  seconds  interesting that a different wish comes up
fast there might be a borkedness in 

 using the latest cvs when i open exmh and the folder im in has unseen
 messages and i hit next exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
 rather than to the first unseen in the current folder

hmm weirdness

 finally when i reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
 the next unseen exmh always goes back to inbox which has no unseen
 messages rather than the next folder with unseen messages  when i 
 goto next from inbox it does go where i would think it should go

ive been seeing this as well  usually with inbox but its gotten
stuck on some other folders as well i have procmail do rcvstore into folders
for me
