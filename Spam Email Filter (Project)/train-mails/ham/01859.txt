javawalk is a coffeeoriented walkingtour of san francisco 

    javawalk is a twohour walk in the city center we start at union square 
    and wind through chinatown jackson square and north beach the citys 
    italian district while we cover the citys coffee roots much more 
    significant than seattles and coffeehouse culture think beatnik we 
    also spend some time on san franciscos history interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city truly some things could only happen in sf javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at north beach cafes for a quick java jolt since cool 
    weather prevails here we need coffee yearround in the city by the bay 
    lucky us
