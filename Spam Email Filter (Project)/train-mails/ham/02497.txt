 hi all
 
 
 i have a prob when trying to install linux tried redhat suse on my
 laptop i can start the install but after about min the whole pc just
 dies
 i know its not a linux prob and here is what i have encountered
 
 i had the same problem when installing win on it and eventually sorted it
 out by disabling the infrared port im guessing this might be same prob
 although im not sure i am very new to linux so its not that easy for me
 to work it out i did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
 using images on disks and it cuts out either as its trying to verify what
 cdrom i have or just after hence my suspicion of the infrared port again
 
 can anyone help 
 
 thanks
 gianni
