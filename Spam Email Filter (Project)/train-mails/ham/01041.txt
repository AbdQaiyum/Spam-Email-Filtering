 followup to the story 
 
 ive now made a subpackage of alsadriver called alsakernel which
 contains only the kernel modules and alsadriver contains everything else
 from the original package device entries include files and docs
 
 this should allow installation of a single alsadriver package and
 multiple alsakernel if you have more than one kernel installed right
 now the dependencies make it mandatory to have kernels installed through
 rpm people who install from source can still install the alsa modules
 from the source though 
 
 the devices are there now thank gordon for reporting the problem and as i
 said you were the only one any further comments are very welcome

 if you arent running kernel for i simply rebuild the
 alsadriver source rpm and youll get a package for your running kernel
