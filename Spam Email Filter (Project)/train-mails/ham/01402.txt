 i recently installed razor v and started using it  i am finding it
 necessary to whitelist a lot of mailing lists  some such as yahoogroups
 i cant whitelist because the from address is the person making the post
 so i will have to whitelist on another field when i can modify my code to do
 so  i wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions or if
 these are bad mailing lists that dont drop bad mail addresses that become
 trollboxes in time

	ive found excellent luck with the xbeenthere header s 
added to to avoid tripping procmail rules

xbeenthere newsjabberorg
