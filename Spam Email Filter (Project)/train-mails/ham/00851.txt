how is this any different from attaching an infobot or alice
through licqs consolehook  people have been doing that for years
and for over a decade in irc and the muds

 and the one thing i think weve learned in all that time is that
as a helpdesk it doesnt work  people just dont like talking to
robots especially when the robots once confused become imbeciles
i think the humans may feel cheated deceived and tricked when they
discover as with the seattle answer that they are talking to a
machine theres no real intelligence behind that simulatedfriendly
and therefore empty thx

aiml is clever and cute but for practical applications as a first
line of technical support  its been tried over and over and while i
also think that it should work for the most part people wont
use it  whats worse as we make the nl processing more and more
clever it only means it fails more dramatically alice doesnt just
stumble a bit it starts to drool  and alice is the best we have

like a dalek all very impressive when things are going well but all
it takes to betray the chickenbrain inside is a towel over its
illplaced eye or a spin off the metal surface 

in all the prologbased nl database query systems of the s and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like shallow red even
simpler tries like ask jeeves people very quickly know theyre
talking to a robot and the queries anneal to short truncated and
terse databaselike verbnoun or just nounkeyword requests  

people are just too quick to adapt and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface and for now especially when the average computer
user still cant type more than maybe wpm nl is a painfully slow
clunky interface

put it this way would you login wake the bot and ask for the seattle
weather or would you do as we all do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop

just for fun heres an interesting conversation between shallow red
alice and eliza as they decide to play the turing game
