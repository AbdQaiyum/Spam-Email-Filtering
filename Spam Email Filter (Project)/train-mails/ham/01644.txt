 otoh my data subtree currently has more than  files slobbering
 over  million bytes  even if i had a place to put that much stuff
 im not sure my isp would let me email it in one msg wink

skip
 do you have a dialup or something more modern wink

much more modern  a cable modem with a small upload rate cap  theres a
reason the less modern uncapped home went out of business wink

 mb of messages zipped would probably compress pretty well  under mb
 id guess with all the similarity in the headers and such  you could zip
 each of the  sets individually and upload them somewhere

i suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon  now wheres
somewhere  i expect well eventually collect several datasets
sourceforge isnt a good place for it they expect projects to distribute
relatively small code files and complain if even those get big

 
 how about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
 something similar manually cleaning it distributing that load over a
 number of people and then relying on your clever code and your
 rebalancing script to help further cleanse it

what then are we training the classifier to do  grahams scoring scheme is
based on an assumption that the hamvsspam task is easy and half of that
is due to that the ham has a lot in common  it was an experiment to apply
his scheme to all the complangpython traffic which is a lot broader than
he had in mind clpy has long had a generous definition of on topic
wink  i dont expect good things to come of making it ever broader
unless your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it
breaks down

 the problem with the ham is it tends to be much more tied to one person
 not just intimate but unique than the spam

which is a feature from grahams pov  the more clues the better this
smoking guns only approach should work

 i save all incoming email for ten days gzipped mbox format before it
rolls
 over and disappears  at any one time i think i have about 
 messages  most of it isnt terribly personal which i would cull before
 passing along anyway and much of it is machinegenerated so would be of
 marginal use  finally its all hamnspam mixed together  do we call
 that an omelette or a dennys grand slam

unless youre volunteering to clean it tag it package it and distribute
it id call it irrelevant wink
