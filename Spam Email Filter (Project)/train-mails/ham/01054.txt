back when i had regular rh there was nothing better than aptget upgrade but
now im running null beta and i have these questions

which version of apt can i use the rh version or the rawhide version

is there a way to use apt to update null with the rpms available for null
through update since i prefer apt to that

if i can use apt can i use it to get updates from these  different places
 the null update redhat upgrades
 the null files at freshrpmsnet
 the regular rh files from freshrpmsnet

am i asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world


thats angle as in geometry
