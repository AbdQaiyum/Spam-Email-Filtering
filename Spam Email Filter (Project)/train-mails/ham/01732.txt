 id prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried
 that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora

guido
 your corpora are biased in this respect though  newsgroups have a
 strong social taboo on posting html but in many peoples personal
 inboxes it is quite abundant

were in violent agreement there  the comments in tokenizerpy say that as
strongly as possible and ive repeated it endlessly here too  but so long
as i was the only one doing serious testing it was a dubious idea to make
the code maximally clumsy for me to use on the clpy task wink

 getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i
 though  my own saved mail doesnt reflect what i receive since i
 save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past 

yup the system picks up on everything in the tokens  grahams proposed
delete as ham and delete as spam keys would probably work very well for
motivated geeks  but paul svensson has pointed out here that they probably
wouldnt work nearly so well for real people

 ah  that explains why the html tags didnt get stripped  id again
 offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that theyd get
 stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that
 would feel too much like a loss wink

 ill bite  sounds like a good idea to strip the html in this case
 id like to see how this improves the fp rate on this corpus

ill soon check in this change

    def tokenizebodyself msg retainpurehtmltagsfalse
                                 
        generate a stream of tokens from an email message

        if a multipartalternative section has both textplain and texthtml
        sections the texthtml section is ignored  this may not be a good
        idea eg the sections may have different content

        html tags are always stripped from textplain sections

        by default html tags are also stripped from texthtml sections
        however doing so hurts the false negative rate on tims
        complangpython tests where htmlonly messages are almost never
        legitimate traffic  if optional argument retainpurehtmltags
        is specified and true html tags are retained in texthtml sections
        

you should do a cvs up and establish a new baseline first as i checked in a
purewin change in the wee hours that cut the fp and fn rates in my tests
