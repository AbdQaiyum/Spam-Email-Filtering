i am somewhat puzzled by a phone call i or rather the cio at the isp for
whom i work received from an individual claiming to represent cloudmark
the gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
information proprietary to cloudmark we would in the near future be
required to begin paying cloudmarkspamnet user per year i was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call

i am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open sourcecommunity aspect of the razor project is going by
the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach ala brightmail and
the likes
