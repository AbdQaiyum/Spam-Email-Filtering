i use exmh  with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
the relevant folder using rcvstore

recently my incoming mail or spool location moved to another disk
im not quite clear how to reconfigure procmailrcvstoreexmh to accept
mail from the new location

there seems to be a variable in exmhdefaults bgspool it says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines so i went ahead and edited it 
that does not make a difference

it seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spoolincoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore so i need to
configure that probably

any idea how i would do this

thanks
siva
