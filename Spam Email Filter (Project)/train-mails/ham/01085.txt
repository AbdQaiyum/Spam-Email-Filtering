 i started wondering how does apt react when it finds a newer kernel in the 
 bunch of to be updated files

look at etcaptaptconf i think kernel matches the kernel packages
apart from those matched by the rest smp enterprise
i think it wont do anything about the kernels come to think of it the
abovementioned might have nothing to do with it

i explicitly use aptget install kernel and then from the list pick a
version and then install kernelfoobar

 and has anyone ever tried to do a distupgrade say from  to  
 should it work if not why

should havent tried with distupgrade but i have put  netboot
mirror ie  into sourceslist and run install stepbystep for iirc
everything worked ok i think therell be a few rpmnew files worth
checking such as especially passwd and group
i think there was a group change lock 

 
it feels great to wake up and not know what day it is doesnt it
