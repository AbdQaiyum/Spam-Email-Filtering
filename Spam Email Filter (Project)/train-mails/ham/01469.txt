 so it seems to me that they do clean up
 their lists but only when a spam fails to
 deliver  or cant they detect that

 what do spammers do with email addresses in
 their database that are undeliverable for a
 few years  do they still continue to spam
 them

well heres my semicoherent rant for the moment  

i have  spamtraps on my machine you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to  the vast majority all but say  have never
ever existed  yet spammers would semicontinuously connect try to
deliver mail to  of them disconnect connect again try delivering
to  more  over and over they kept getting user unknown until i
got around to making them spamtraps

so my evidence would suggest that it depends who youre dealing with 
if your business is to sell address lists to people who would then spam
its in your best interest to never clean your list  therefore you can
say  million email addresses and not technically be lying even if
the majority of them dont work

if youre a spammer youd want to know who doesnt actually exist but
then again you dont really care you probably want to relay through
someone so its harder to trace you if you could youd send to every
email address available you dont want to setup a valid bounce address
because again its easy to trace you

so i would say this if you technically spam people but actually think
youre running a legit service you probably really do have a way of
opting out even though the user didnt opt in and you probably dont
relay and you probably pay attention to bounces

everyone else doesnt really care


thats my view anyway
