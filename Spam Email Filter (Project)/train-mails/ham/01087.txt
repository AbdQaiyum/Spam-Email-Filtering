 it skips it see the etcaptaptconf file for this

    leave list empty to disable
   allowedduppkgs kernel kernelsmp kernelenterprise 
   holdpkgs kernelsource kernelheaders

if i understand this correctly then only kernelsource and kernelheaders 
are held from being installed but kernel will be installed right

maybe i should test this on some vanilla system
