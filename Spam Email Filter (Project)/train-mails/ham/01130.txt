 oops  turns out i wasnt careful installing it so the exmhlibrary
 variable was pointing at my old installation  im surprised it worked
 as well as it did
 
 in any case i removed the old library directory and edited exmh
 exmhbg exmhstrip etc to point at the right one  now im getting
 another traceback on startup
 
 cant read mhprivpubseqfamilycur no such variable
     while executing
 mhseq folder seq add mhprivpubseqfolderseq mhseqexpand
 folder msgids
     procedure mhreadseqs line 
     invoked from within
 mhreadseqs folder seqs
     procedure mhsequences line 
     invoked from within
 mhsequences folder
     procedure flistunseenupdate line 
     invoked from within
 flistunseenupdate folder
     procedure folderchange line 
     invoked from within
 folderchange family msgshow cur
     invoked from within
 time list  folderchange folder msgshowproc
     procedure folderchange line 
     invoked from within
 folderchange exmhfolder
     procedure exmh line 
     invoked from within
 exmh
     after script
 
 
 family is the folder i was in when i quit exmh

that shouldnt have been able to happen but ive just made the code slightly 
more bullet proof
