  my main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages ive made
  for psyche on valhalla id need to lower the release tag to keep
  an upgrade working and that would fck up my cvs repository which is
  on my valhalla box
 
 sorry i dont get it whats wrong with a release tag of fr

say you have installed synapticfr on your valhalla box package
rebuilt for valhalla then you upgrade to psyche using the red hat cds
hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
although i doubt that since c is binary incompatible so this is
probably a bad example then you aptget update with the new psyche
repository and theres where the problem will be  it will say that
there are two synapticfr packages one installed the other
available with the same version but different dependencies 
thats why i always keep package versions lower for older distributions
