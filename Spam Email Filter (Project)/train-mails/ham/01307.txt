 has anyone made a working source rpm for dvdrip for red hat 

i dont think ive tried yet but if i did i probably moved on to another
package after having bumped into one of the problems you mention

if anyone sends me a patch to my spec file and eventually needed patches
etc id be more than glad to make a new build available
