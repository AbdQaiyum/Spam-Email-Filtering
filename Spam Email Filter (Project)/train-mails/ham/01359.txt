 if i were a spammer id simply set up a server send out my 
 spam with the
 habeus headers and continue till i was reasonably certain id 
 been reported
 then id simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a 
 different ip  as
 long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is
 directing people to im home free

uh the reason is simple habeas runs something called the 
habeas infringers list and if you use their trademark without 
their permission youll end up on it  then when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header users of sa  supports 
this will tag your mail as spam rather than let it through 
this may be done independantly of your ip address so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam

also that little haiku is a copyrighted work so not only can 
habeas sue they must sue to protect their copyright and since 
its a trademark as well thats a doublewhammy habeas has 
some pretty highpowered legal people who will gladly go to 
town on violators

the whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business and not only block mail 
from them but allow through the things that really arent spam
