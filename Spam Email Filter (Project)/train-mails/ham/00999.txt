 i run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting exmh
 windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops gratis ssh
 x forwarding  in fact your message was read and replied to this
 message while at work using an exmh instance running on my home
 machine

 so you have  copies  per desktop of exmh running

yes

one of the nicer aspects of exmhs colour handling is that while i have
the default background for the message pane set to black the second
insance of exmh displaying to a given display will set the background
of the message pane to darkslategray  very nice as it provides an
instant visual cue as to which is which  no ive not checked where it
gets that colour selection from

 thats what i usually do but what id really like would be some
 automagism to tell them flist rescan folder which i now do
 manually whenever im going to work at the other machine

nod
