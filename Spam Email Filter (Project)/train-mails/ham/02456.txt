one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the firefighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the firefighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who arent on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must livework within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time firefighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives  miles from his station so how hell respond to fire calls at night is a mystery  and i cant see many firefighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations
