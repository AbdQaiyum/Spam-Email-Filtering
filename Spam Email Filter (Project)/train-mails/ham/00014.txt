   any chance of having that lengthen instead   i like all my exmh stuff
   in nice columns fits the display better   that is i use the detache
 d
   folder list one column   the main exmh window takes up full screen
   top to bottom but less than half the width etc
 
 i thought about that  the first order approximation would be to just add 
 using pack  side top instead of pack  side left however since their 
 each a different width it would look funny

ive done this  its not as pretty as i think it should be but it works  
im going to leave the cosmetic issues to others  when i update the 
documentation ill add this to the exmhtodo file

im leaving for a   week vacation in a week so this is the last new 
functionality im going to add for a while  also i now have pretty much 
everything in there that i want for my own use so im probably pretty much 
done  ill work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards
