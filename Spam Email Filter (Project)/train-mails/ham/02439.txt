postcards from planet google

internet the search engine is taking snapshots of its users minds and 
aggregating them so what is the world thinking about

jennifer  lee

at googles squat headquarters off route  visitors sit in the lobby 
transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the 
receptionists desk animacioaacn japonese harry potter penseaaces 
et poemes associao brasileira de normas teaaccnicas

the projected display called live query shows updated samples of what 
people around the world are typing into googles search engine the 
terms scroll by in english chinese spanish swedish japanese korean 
french dutch italian  any of the  languages that google tracks

the scrolling continues people who shouldnt marry she smoked a 
cigar mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto 
theft fraud how to

stare at live query long enough and you feel you are watching the 
collective consciousness of the world stream by

each line represents a thought from someone somewhere with an internet 
connection google collects these queries   million a day from more 
than  countries  in its databases updating and storing the computer 
logs millisecond by millisecond

google is taking snapshots of its users minds and aggregating them

so what is the world thinking about

sex for one thing

you can learn to say sex in a lot of different languages by looking 
at the logs said craig silverstein director of technology at google 
to keep live query grated google filters out sexrelated searches 
though less successfully with foreign languages

despite its geographic and ethnic diversity the world is spending much 
of its time thinking about the same things the same topic areas bubble 
to the top celebrities current events products and computer downloads

its amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what 
they are searching for said greg rae one of three members of 
googles logs team which is responsible for building storing and 
protecting the data record

googles following  it is the most widely used search engine  has 
given mr rae a worldview from his cubicle since october  he has 
been able to reel off anthrax in several languages including 
milzbrand in german and carbonchio in italian he says he can also tell 
which countries took their recent elections seriously brazil and 
germany because of the frenzy of searches he notes that the 
globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are 
farflung in origin nokia sony bmw ferrari ikea and microsoft

judging from googles data some sports events stir interest almost 
everywhere the tour de france wimbledon the melbourne cup horse race 
and the world series were among the top  sportsrelated searches last 
year it also becomes obvious just how familiar american movies music 
and celebrities are to searchers across the globe two years ago a 
google engineer named lucas pereira noticed that searches for britney 
spears had declined indicating what he thought must be a decline in her 
popularity from that observation grew google zeitgeist a listing of 
the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month

glancing over google zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural 
literacy ulrika jonsson the swedishborn british television host and 
girlfriend of england football coach sven goran eriksson made the list 
recently so did irish travellers a nomadic ethnic group one of whose 
members was videotaped beating her young daughter in indiana and 
fentanyl the narcotic gas used in the moscow raid to rescue hostages 
taken by chechen rebels in late october

the longlasting volume of searches involving her name has made britney 
spears something of a benchmark for the logs team it has helped them 
understand how news can cause spikes in searches as it did when she 
broke up with justin timberlake

google can feel the reverberations of such events and others of a more 
serious nature immediately

on feb   for example an earthquake began near seattle at  
am local time within two minutes earthquakerelated searches jumped to 
 a minute from almost none with a concentration in the us pacific 
northwest on sept  searches for the world trade center pentagon and 
cnn shot up immediately after the attacks over the next few days 
nostradamus became the top search query fuelled by a rumour that 
nostradamus had predicted the trade centers destruction

but the most trivial events may also register on googles sensitive 
cultural seismic meter

the logs team came to work one morning to find that carol brady maiden 
name had surged to the top of the charts

curious they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they 
were neatly grouped in five spikes each one starting at  minutes 
after the hour

as the logs were passed through the office employees were perplexed 
why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the s 
sitcom the brady bunch but the data could only reflect patterns not 
explain them

that is a paradox of a google log it does not capture social phenomena 
per se but merely the shadows they cast across the internet

the most interesting part is why said amit patel who has been a 
member of the logs team you cant interpret it unless you know what 
else is going on in the world

so what had gone on on april  

that night the milliondollar question on the game show who wants to be 
a millionaire had been what was carol bradys maiden name seconds 
after the shows host posed the question thousands flocked to google to 
search for the answer tyler producing four spikes as the show was 
broadcast successively in each us time zone

the precision of the carol brady data was eyeopening for some

it was like trying an electron microscope for the first time said 
sergey brin who as a graduate student in computer science at stanford 
helped found google in  and is now its president for technology 
it was like a momentbymoment barometer

predictably googles query data respond to television movies and 
radio but the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences 
one of googles strengths is its predictive power flagging trends 
before they hit the radar of other media

as such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or 
retailers google is quiet about what if any plans it has for 
commercialising its vast store of query information there is 
tremendous opportunity with this data mr silverstein said the 
challenge is defining what we want to do

google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data 
because of privacy concerns searches are logged by time of day 
originating ip address information that can be used to link searches to 
a specific computer and the sites on which the user clicked people 
tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly 
 viagra pregnancy scares fraud facelifts what is interesting in the 
aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual

in aggregate form googles data can make a stunning presentation next 
to mr raes cubicle is the geodisplay a inch screen that gives a 
threedimensional geographical representation of where google is being 
used around the globe the searches are represented by coloured dots 
shooting into the atmosphere the colours  red yellow orange  convey 
the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire the tallest 
flames are in new york tokyo and the san francisco bay area

each country has a distinctive usage pattern spain france and italy 
have a midday lull in google searches presumably reflecting leisurely 
lunches and relaxation in japan the peak usage is after midnight when 
phone rates for dialup modems drop

googles worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and 
phenomena as they hop from country to country

take las ketchup a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in 
spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying kneeknocking 
dance similar to the macarena

like a series of waves google searches for las ketchup undulated 
through europe over the summer and fall

the ketchup song hey hah has already topped the charts in  
countries in late summer googles logs show las ketchup searches 
began a strong upward climb in the united states britain and the 
netherlands

havent heard of las ketchup

if you havent google predicts you soon will
