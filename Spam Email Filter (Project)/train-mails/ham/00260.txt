the academic discipline of software engineering was launched at a conference
sponsored by nato at garmisch germany in october  intriguingly the
term software engineering was chosen to be deliberately provocative  why
cant software be developed with the same rigor used by other engineering
disciplines

the proceedings of this conference are now available online at
