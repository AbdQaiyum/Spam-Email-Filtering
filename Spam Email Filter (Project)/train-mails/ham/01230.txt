 since i upgraded to redhat mplayer vo sdl isnt working for me
 it gives me black screen and i only hear sound
 
 can anyone help me with this 

ill test this as soon as i can

 btw
 also the source rpm specified that i can do without libdv
 but it didnt work worked for lirc and arts

should be fixed  you probably had libdvdevel installed and mplayer
automatically detected it the new spec file explicitely passes
disablelibdv when the package is rebuilt with without libdv

grab the fr spec from here
