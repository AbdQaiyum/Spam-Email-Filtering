using razor via spamassasin

system is solaris  with qmail spamassassin run via users procmail
all users who use sa have run razorregister

razor is failing and i cant find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it
and im hoping someone can help

the error which doesnt prevent sa from working is

oct    sancho qmail  delivery  success

looking at dnspm doesnt really help me and razorclientagent appears 
to be in the right place
in usrlocallibperlsiteperlrazorclient

ideas
