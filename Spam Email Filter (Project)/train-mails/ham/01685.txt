 looks like your ham corpus by and large has to jeremyalummitedu in
 a header while your spam corpus by and large doesnt  but this one

interestingly for me one of the highest value spam indicators was
the name of the mail host that the spam was delivered to in the to
line so mail to infoginelaxekorpcom was pretty much a dead cert
for the filters
