hi all

anyone ever try connecting at bps in linux ive got a usr k
faxmodem which is meant to connect to another same modem and i have to
connect at this speed due to the nt port settings on the remote side
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed

the modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds bps to
bps but that is no good for txrxing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treaclebps

note minicom fails to handshake at bps but hyperterm in windows
worked first time any ideas

baud   data bits even parity

i am doing a atz to reset the modem then i send this init string

atfevqxysabcdhikmnprsuy

 which is most of the defaults

usr said to set s disables v 
 set s disable v  x

but the s just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up

btw this is a banks system i am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult
