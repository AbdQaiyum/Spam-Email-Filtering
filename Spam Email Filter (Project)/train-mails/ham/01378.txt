guys the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while were getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries where those judgments are harder to get

please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers  yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but the
vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles  so i
cant understand how daniel can assert that you cant track spammers
down when its never really been tried  we can subpoena the records of
the business they spammed on behalf of  we can subpoena the records of
the isp that provided them service and of the credit card they used for
the whackamole accounts  we can use private investigators  yes
these people are often lowlifes chickenboners  but theyre not
secret agents  theyre just trying to make a buck and habeas whole
business is about finding them and putting them out of business

habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers that use our warrant mark
in a way that no one ever has had before  given that our whole business
plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with not spam i cant
understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
unsuccessful plan for that failure and in so doing remove the
potential of success which is antispam filters like sa acting on the
habeas warrant mark

daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on
your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all violators on
the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove
us from the next release  but youre trying to kill habeas before it
has a chance to show any promise

at the end of the day spamassassin is like the club in that it
encourages thieves spammers to just go after the next car those
without sa rather than yours  habeas can play the role of lojack the
transmitter in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they dont
steal any more cars  but only if were given a chance to succeed

matthew cline mattnightrealmscom writes

 there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are
 planning on making money from the spam  what a court would consider
 evidence of being the spammer is another question

haha

just a few notes

  it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone
   in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a
   good example even if they do officially respect copyright law

  law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court
   case we could have years of spam in our mail boxes

  contact information can change phone numbers po boxes stolen
   cell phones temporary email addresses etc

  spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i
   dont understand it either but nobody said they were bright  also
   some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example
   pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way
