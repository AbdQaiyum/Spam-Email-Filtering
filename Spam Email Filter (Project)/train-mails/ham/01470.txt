 subject satalk getting yourself removed from spam lists

 i get the feeling that the spammers never
 remove emails from their lists

correct

 on the other hand that doesnt make sense
 wouldnt they get worried about their millions
 of spams being wasted  dont they want some
 prove that they indeed reach people somehow

no they only have to prove that they send several million
emails to potential clients to get their money  i dont think
they even care much about bounces  theyre conartists why
should they care about proving they actually reached people
 
 so it seems to me that they do clean up
 their lists but only when a spam fails to
 deliver  or cant they detect that

most of the time the bounce goes to some poor soul who has
nothing to do with the spammer

 what do spammers do with email addresses in
 their database that are undeliverable for a
 few years  do they still continue to spam
 them

yes
