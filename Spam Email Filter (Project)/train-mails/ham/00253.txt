hello again i tried all the suggestions for the pctel driver and at the end of it everything still goes smoothly until i type make after i get the output from the configure 

however there were a couple of things i noticed along the way after typing 
 cp configskernelconfig config
 make oldconfig
 make dep
the nd to last line i got back said that the modversionsh file was not updated when i looked at this path to the modversionsh file it was  lines and every line started with a  mark is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a  mark or am i just thinking of another language and so should i delete the  at certain places

also when i was in the pctel directory and typed make i noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversionsh file inside this other file theres nothing at all and so i moved the modversionsh file with  lines to the empty modversionsh file  and got a different reply after make the output after i moved the file over mostly looked like this
usrsrclinuxlinuxmodversionsh linuxmodulesadbver no such file or directory
usrsrclinuxlinuxmodversionsh linuxmodulesafaxver no such file or directory
usrsrclinuxlinuxmodversionsh linuxmodulesafipxver no such file or directory

the odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are whats written after the  in the modversionsh file should there be a file at each of these one at each of the  lines of the file that id have to compilemake

its taken plenty of elbow grease but im glad it hasnt gone smoothly its a good learning experience again any help is appreciated thanks eric
