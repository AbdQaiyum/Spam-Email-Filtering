as the subject line indicates im sure these are stupid questions but
im having trouble getting sa working like i understand it should work
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself

if a user has a line like

whitelistfrom yahoogroupscom

in his spamassassinuserprefs file does that line not in effect
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroupscom or is there still checking being done against it  and if
the latter what does he need to place in userprefs to cause such mail
to be ignored  im testing sa here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists before deploying it systemwide and although the above
line has been added to their userprefs files much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger sa

thanks in advance for any help
