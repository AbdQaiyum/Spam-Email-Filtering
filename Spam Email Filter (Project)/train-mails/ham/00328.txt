           ant writes from page  of firingsquads
           quakecon  postmortem article john carmack said
           something at the end of the qa about how the
           multiplayer will be only four players tim after  hours of
           talking up at the podium sometimes you leave a few details
           out doom  multiplayer will be fully scalable it will be a
           peer to peer system we havent started working on it yet
           tell everyone not to panic  it will be fine john just forgot
           to mention itll be scalable past four players its hard to
           give a hard number because we havent started working on
           it yet right now were focused on making doom  a
           kickass over the top single player game
