i am wondering whether theres a way that i can use sitescooper andor plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly

i dont have a windows machine so it becomes problematic to convert them
i know that if this were not the case in word i could save them as some
other more friendly format

even if explicitly stated to the contrary nothing in this posting should 
be construed as representing my employers opinions
