 just to further weaken the food transaction argument ill note that
in
 my neighborhood the local mcdonalds wont even hand you your drink in
 the drive through until you fork over the cash  


maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor

 and why is it that the margin of survival is so thin  could it be
that
 all of these tribal rivalries are part of whats holding back
wholesale
 movement to the modern first world patterns of constructive thinking

well yes  but it doesnt change the idea that the margin of survival
probably is that thin in this region

 im sure that both sides were ready to be the agressor  

im not  im sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor
provided they were in a predominant position of power

 bushs reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by
your
 local madrassa or kkk leader apparently because he is fully involved
 with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the
solution
 to the worlds ills is disappointing  he has spoke against madrassa
 but what i heard sounded lame and carefully crafted to shield religion
 in general from scrutiny

 which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters
 the us is trying to avoid making war on the muslim religion
 us leadership remains reflexively multicultural

 we all have
 disagreements but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity

i didnt say burning the train was a good thing  i said i understood it
wasnt a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong
