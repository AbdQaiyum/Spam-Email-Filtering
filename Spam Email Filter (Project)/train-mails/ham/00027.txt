folks
 
my first time posting  have a bit of unix experience but am new to linux

 
just got a new pc at home  dell box with windows xp added a second hard disk
for linux partitioned the disk and have installed suse  from cd which went
fine except it didnt pick up my monitor
 
i have a dell branded efpp  lcd flat panel monitor and a nvidia geforce
ti video card both of which are probably too new to feature in suses default
set i downloaded a driver from the nvidia website and installed it using rpm
then i ran sax as was recommended in some postings i found on the net but
it still doesnt feature my video card in the available list what next
 
another problem i have a dell branded keyboard and if i hit capslock twice
the whole machine crashes in linux not windows  even the onoff switch is
inactive leaving me to reach for the power cable instead
 
if anyone can help me in any way with these probs id be really grateful 
ive searched the net but have run out of ideas
 
or should i be going for a different version of linux such as redhat opinions
welcome
 
thanks a lot
peter
