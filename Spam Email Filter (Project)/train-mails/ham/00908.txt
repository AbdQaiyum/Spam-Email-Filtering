the united states is the only country in the world to tax its citizens
on a worldwide basis 
      


i am told this is also true at least
for australia  i suppose i shouldnt
rely upon editorial factchecking



  

                              if they manage to emulate the process
that occurred in northern ireland then maybe in  years or so
theyll be yelling at each other across the floor of some legislative
assembly instead  label me an optimist
    


since lets you and him fight worked
so remarkably poorly in ireland there
mustve been plenty of places it worked
well for the british to have tried it
again in israel  what were they

im not sure what you mean by lets you and him fight but it is 
important to remember that england was in control of ireland
for  years and that it was only thanks to the distraction of ww i 
that the south managed to gain its independence if you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line it also seems to have not worked in
indiapakistan
i suppose canada which is supposed to be a loose confederation of  
founding nations french and english can be cited as a success the 
jury is still out but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such still together after  years

owen
