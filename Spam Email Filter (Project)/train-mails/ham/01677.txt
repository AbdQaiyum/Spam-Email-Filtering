     tim yuck it got two s from embedding your email address at the
     tim bottom here

 which suggests that tagging email addresses in tocc headers should be
 handled differently than in message bodies

i dont know whether it suggests that but they would be tagged differently
in tocc if i were tagging them at all right now  if i were tagging to
addresses for example the tokens would look like

    toemail addrmit

instead of

    email addrmit

as they appear when an emaillike thingie is found in the body  whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something i havent tested
