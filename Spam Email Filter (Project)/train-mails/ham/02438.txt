most pseudoscientists have a number of characteristics in
common

        first and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation    in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers    the modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part  it is due he claims
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas   

        the modern pseudoscientist    stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated  he works in isolation  he does not
send his findings to the recognized journals or if he does they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent  in most cases the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study  as a consequence he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field  in fact the
reputable scientist does not even know of the cranks
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
nonacademic channels or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature  the eccentric is forced therefore
to tread a lonely way  he speaks before organizations he
himself has founded contributes to journals he himself may
edit and  until recently  publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately

        a second characteristic of the pseudo scientist which
greatly strengthens his isolation is a tendency toward
paranoia   

        there are five ways in which the sincere pseudo
scientists paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited

         he considers himself a genius

         he regards his colleagues without exception as
ignorant blockheads  everyone is out of step except himself
frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity dishonesty or other base motives  if they ignore
him he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable
if they retaliate in kind this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels   

         he believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against   

         he has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories  when
newton was the outstanding name in physics eccentric works
in that science were violently anti newton  today with
einstein the father symbol of authority a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack einstein in the name of newton   

         he often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined
