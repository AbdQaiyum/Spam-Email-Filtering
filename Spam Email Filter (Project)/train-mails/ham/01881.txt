jeffrey zeldman os x blues update 

    a couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of os x which derives its power from unix and xml and the rules of 
    standardsbased web development which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different nonstandard hacks the parallel 
    is not without merit building web pages the right way is hard at first 
    but once you get it you never want to go back regardless we miss os s 
    flexibility and ease of use and a metric ton of logic doesnt offset that 
    feeling of loss
