 how about applying this to the default aptconf shipped with the
 freshrpmsnet apt package  i found it a bit weird when the behaviour
 changed between the old x and the new x versions so that when
 doing a aptget upgrade it wouldnt tell me which packages were to
 be upgraded just that it was about to upgrade something

indeed i found that strange too then i noticed the u switch and used
that but your solution is much better  the next apt build will
incorporate this change not worth a rebuild for this and as some
relatively important cnc bugs are currently being fixed id say cnc
isnt far off
