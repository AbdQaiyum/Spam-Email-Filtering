 i just set up razor and spamassassin but i keep getting this error in my 
 mail log file
 
 razor check skipped no such file or directory cant call method log on 
 unblessed reference at 
 usrlocallibperlsiteperlrazorclientagentpm line 
 
 i have looked through the archived list and the only thing i have seen 
 about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file
 i did what it said in the archives basically change the permission on the 
 file but its still no go
 
 any other help would be appreciated maybe im missing something
 something i forgot to run or do
