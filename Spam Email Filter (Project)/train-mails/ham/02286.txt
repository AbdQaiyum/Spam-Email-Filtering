sixdegress is a  os x app that datamines your own harddrive and tries to 
build links between people files and folders laura carpenter at the os x con 
was talking it up yesterday and it looks way cool  ive just downloaded the 
demo to play with 

     locate files with similar names or file revisions anywhere on your 
    system

     show all email threads related to any file or person on your desktop

     view all the files a person has sent you regardless of where those files 
    are stored on your computer

     create dynamic selfupdating projects

     find misfiles or attachments quickly without searching desktop folders

     navigate and open any message file or person on your desktop in one 
    click  

link discuss thanks laura
