 i think ill ask this question again as i sent on friday afternoon
  


 mailman 

 trust me you do not want to running your own mailing lists
 on your own software

 youll wind up crying in a dark room looking for something
 highvoltage to stick your fingers into

all things considered i get that effect with mailman but the viable
alternatives are ezmlm which is loonware and im avoiding on principle
and majordomo which seems to have stagnated oh and theres apparently
something called smartlist which is a bitch to set up
