 can anyone out there who uses sa with lotus notes users help us figure 
 out what to tell customers to do when theyve got emails coming in with 
 spam identifying headers weve been told that notes has no way to 
 handle extra headers but im sure that cant be universally true
 
 ive searched the net and it seems that notes can only filter based on 
 the visible headers ie sender subject precedence etc is there 
 any way to filter based on x headers

 yes the only way out with notes looks like changing the subject 
subjecttag
