 here are the instructions in the spamassassin readme

      tar xfvz dccdccproctarz
      cd dccdccprocxxx
      configure  make  make install
      cdcc new map
      cdcc add dccrhyolitecom
      cdcc info

 thats ok except that the new map and add dccrhyolitecom
 are respectively unnecessary and wrong  the map file that comes
 with the source points to localhost and dccdccserversnet  those
 two shipped entries usually do the right thing if there is a local
 server  if there is no local server or if the local server fails
 requests are instantly sent to one of the public server names listed
 in the main dcc web page at
 httpwwwrhyolitecomantispamdcc and httpwwwdcc
 serversnetdcc
 dccrhyolitecom has not been listed for months
