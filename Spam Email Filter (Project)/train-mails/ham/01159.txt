 i cvsed the unseensequences changes and installed them and have only one 
 real issue
 
 i use the unseen window rather than the exmh icon and with the new code
 i cant seem to be able to  how many unseen when when i have the main window open
 is not really necessary

hmmm i stole the code from unseenwin but i never tested it since i dont use 
that functionality  consider it on my list of things to check
