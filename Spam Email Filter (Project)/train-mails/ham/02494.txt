 bomber targets dutch ikea stores 
 
 police in the netherlands are searching all  outlets of the ikea furniture
 chain in the country after finding bombs in two stores 

 

like everyone else i had become a
slave to the ikea nesting instinct
if i saw something like clever coffee

catalogs and wonder what kind of dining
set defines me as a person we used to
read pornography now it was the horchow
collection i had it all even the glass
dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections

simple hardworking indigenous peoples of
wherever
  jack fight club 


in fight club tyler durden destroys this nesting instinct by bombing 
jacks apartment hmmmm
