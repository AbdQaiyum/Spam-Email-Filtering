morten frederiksen has taken a first stab at a realtime social network 
explorer based on foaf files you could start on my profile and explore from 
there or enter the url of your own foaf file at the bottom of the page its 
heavy on tech details but you can easily see the potential here its also a 
great way to debug your foaf file if you added anything manually now we need 
somebody to build a spider that follows foafknows links and draws pretty 
social network diagrams so we can see the forest for the trees
