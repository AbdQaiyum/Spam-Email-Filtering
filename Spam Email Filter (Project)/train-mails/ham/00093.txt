 hi all
 the serial number in our hosts files on our dns server has gone 
 corrupt eg  should be 
 its okay to set this back to todays date but i understand that our 
 secondary and terninary dns servers will only update from the master 
 hosts file if the master host serial number is greater than the current 
 serial number in the hosts file
 is there any way i can reset this on the secondary and terninary dns 
 servers

once you have the serial changed on the master dns server remove
the appropiate zones on your slaves and refresh your dns servers

bind has a special case if you set the serial to  i think dns 
bind should have something on that
