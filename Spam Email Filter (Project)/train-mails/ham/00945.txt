    hmmm i assume youre going to report this to the nmh folks
 
 yes i will sometime after i look at the nmh sources and see what
 they have managed to break and why
 
 but we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
 exist dont we   the patch to have exmh do the right thing whether this
 bug exists or not is trivial so id suggest including it
 
 patch follows 
 
 i have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
 before not that it should make any difference to nmh or mh   but since
 i stopped doing that the variable msgs isnt really needed any more
 rather than assigning pickmsgs to msgs and then using msgs the code
 could just use pickmsgs where msgs is now used   this is just a
 frill though so i didnt change that  

ill fix this in cvs this afternoon

thanks
chris
