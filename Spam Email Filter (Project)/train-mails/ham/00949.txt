 im perfectly willing to canopener that code and see where the cpu is
 going but only if nobody is slapping their forehead and mumbling about
 a brownpaperbag bug 

as i mentioned in my email to anders its certainly in my code and i dont 
have time to work on it right now so i would not be offended if you worked on 
it

i just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
done before my vacation that will require my efforts so its even more true 
that it was when i sent the mail to anders
