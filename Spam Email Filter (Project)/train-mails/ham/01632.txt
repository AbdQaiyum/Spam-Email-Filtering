  this make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards
 they have an internal procession unit around mhz  can we consider them as
 trusted hardware 

smartcards do not have fixed clock rates more often than not as the iso spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked but smartcards used 
for security purposes usually javacards have builtin crypto coprocessors 
that make clock rate irrelevant mhz smartcards can often preform tripledes 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed

that said clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is as michael 
pointed out theres something of an armsrace between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate and time and time again 
what weve seen is that its not a question of is it secure its a 
question of who is it secure from and for how long security is rarely a 
question of absolutes despite the often boolean nature of a break rather 
its a question of assessing quantifying and managing risk smartcards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
 range depending on the application

as whether or not they are trusted hardware the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe one might expect a bored undergrad ee student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than 
say a governtment intelligence service if your goal is to keep undergrad 
ees from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria then a smartcard is 
likely trustworthy enough for your application if your aim is to protect 
icbm launch codes then its probably the wrong tool in either application 
a riskcost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question
