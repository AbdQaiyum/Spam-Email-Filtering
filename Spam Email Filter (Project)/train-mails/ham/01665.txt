  note that header names are case insensitive so this ones no
  different than mimeversion  similarly other headers in your list
 
 ignoring case here may or may not help thats for experiment to decide
 its plausible that case is significant if eg a particular spam mailing
 package generates unusual case or a particular clueless spammer
 misconfigures his package

case of headers is definitely helpful  spamassassin has a rule for it
 if you have headers like date or subject you get a few more
points
