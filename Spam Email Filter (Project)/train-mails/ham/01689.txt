i actually like neales xspamdisposition header i just wonder if maybe we
should choose something with a different prefix than xspam so that
people dont confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with
that prefix

also some sort of version information would be useful  perhaps the cvs
version number for the classifier module could be tacked on

skip
