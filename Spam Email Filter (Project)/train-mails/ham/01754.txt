how were these msgs broken up into the  sets  set in particular is giving
the other sets severe problems and set blows the fn rate on everything
its predicting  when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
as much as a factor of  it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
the sets were chosen  for example perhaps they were broken into sets by
arrival time  if thats what you did you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead  if you did partition them randomly the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious


 i expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
 grepping  be sure to stare at the false positives and get the
 spam out of there

 yah but theres a chickenandegg problem there  i want stuff thats
 known to be right to test this stuff

then you have to look at every message by eyeball  any scheme has nonzero
error rates of both kinds

 so using the spambayes code to tell me whether its spam is not
 going to help

trust me wink  it helps a lot  i expect everyone who has done any
testing here has discovered spam in their ham and vice versa  results
improve as you improve the categorization  once the gross mistakes are
straightened out its much less tedious to scan the rest by eyeball

on skip tokens
 yep it shows up in a lot of spam but also in different forms in hams
 but the hams each manage to pick a different variant of
 
 or whatever  so they dont end up counteracting the various bits in the
 spam

 looking further a lot of the bad skip rubbish is coming from
 uuencoded viruses c in the spamset

for whatever reason there appear to be few of those in brucegs spam
collection  i added code to strip uuencoded sections and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead  ill check it in  it didnt make a significant
difference on my usual test run a single spam in my set is now judged as
ham by the other  sets nothing else changed  it does shrink the database
size here by a few percent  let us know whether it helps you
