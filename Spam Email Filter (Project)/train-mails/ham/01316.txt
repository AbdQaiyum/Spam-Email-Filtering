i think with the confusion and all we should give these folks 
until the end of the day to get fixed logs uploaded 

justin on a related note  i didnt include the spamtrap stuff 
from the corpus directory on your server in my logs but that 
should definitely be in there  dont know if youd included it 
in yours or not  i think its from kelseys mailtraps
