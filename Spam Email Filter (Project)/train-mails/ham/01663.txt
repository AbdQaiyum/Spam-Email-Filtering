i think that when considering deployment a solution that supports all
python platforms and not just the lunix crowd is desirable

mac and pc users are more apt to be using a commercial mua thats unlikely
to offer hooking ability at least not easily as mentioned elsewhere even
lunix users may find an mua solution easier to use then getting it added to
their mta sysops make programmers look like flaming liberals 

my notion of a solution for windowsoutlook has been as guido described a
clientserver client side does popimapmapi fetching of which im only
going to implement pop initially potentially on several hosts spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message qmail style the
mua accesses this ethunk as a server to obtain all the ham spam is
retained in the ethunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection and training of spam filter
and the ham will go forward after being used for training on the next mua
fetch ethunk would sit on a timer for always online users but i am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme

outbound mail would use a direct path from the mua to the mta hopefully all
muas can split the host fetchsend urls

imo end users are likely to be more intested in nway classification if
this is available the simple viewer could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and at least for me the outlook nightmare is over  i would
use this as my only mua nb according to my recent readings the best
nway classifier uses something called a support vector machine svm
which is  more accurate then naive bayes nb 

i wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code that way it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the users situation
