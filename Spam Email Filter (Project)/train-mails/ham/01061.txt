    
 hello
   
         i just installed redhat  and i think i have everything 
working properly  anyway i want to install mplayer because i heard it 
can play quicktime movs  i aptget source mplayer and dld it to 
usrsrc 

         i tried to just rpm rebuild mplayerfrsrcrpm 
then i get  mplayerfrsrcrpm no such file or directory
