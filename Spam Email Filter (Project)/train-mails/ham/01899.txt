one of the weirdest things i heard when listening to the cato institute debate 
was an economist claim a tenet of my profession is that people wont pay for 
something they can get for free someone objected using the analogy of 
bottled water theres a far better example the new york times  

incredibly this institution puts out pages and pages of highquality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit waiting to be sold to 
people meanwhile the exact same content is available for free using an 
insidious peertopeer downloading system called the web by typing in the 
keyword wwwnytimescom those people at the new york times must not 
understand the internet or something 

more examples the thriving shareware market the baen free library janis ian 
and others 

other times people claim that no one will create if they cant get paid id 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the 
planet
