on mon aug   at pm  john p looney mentioned
  this is likely because to get it to boot like the cobalt im actually
 passing rootdevhda to the kernel not devmd 

 just to solve thisthe reason i was booting the box with
rootdevhda not devmd was because devmd wasnt booting  it
would barf with cant find init

 it turns out that this is because i was populating md with tar which
seems to have issues with crosslinked files  for instance it was
trying to make a hard link of glibcso to hda  and failing it was only
as i did it again with a friend present that he spotted the errors and
queried them we noticed that the hard linked files just didnt exist on
the new rootfs

 when we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar it worked
fine i was able to tell lilo to use rootdevmd and everything worked

 woohoo
