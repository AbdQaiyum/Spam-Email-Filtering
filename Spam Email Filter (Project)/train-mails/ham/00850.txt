this is something new or at least new to me 

    politspam n using a spam engine for political purposes

in this particular case to get back at the university of groningen
the content suggests its more prank than vigilante activism in the
old days we used to say someone left their terminal unguarded
but whats interesting is that its not trying to sell me anything
or lead me to any forfee service its just trying to spread
a meme that rug is evil
