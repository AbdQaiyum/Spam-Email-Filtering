 we have any statistics on the poor mans divorce from
 centuries past are you so sure that the kids in th

thats easy divorce didnt happen the church and the society looked
after that only relatively recently that privilege was granted to kings 
and only very recently to commoners

 century england were any more functional than those
 today what about th century saudi arabia

is saudi arabia a meaningful emigration source
 
 at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and 
 counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
 something wrong
 
 granting your first two points im skeptical about
 the last do you see any signs that america specifically

i wasnt talking about the us specifically though the demographics 
problem exists there as well albeit not in that extent we eurotrash are 
facing right now

 innovation visavis youth nations such as iran the

 im seeing lack of innovation and  more disturbing  trend towards
even less innovation by an autocatalytic process gerontocracy favors
