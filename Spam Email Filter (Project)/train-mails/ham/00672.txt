glm whereas political brochures are not the statistics clearly show
glm which is the greater more senseless and more preventable killer

so outside of the occasional hit by a mafiaboy wheres the killing

if you said mindnumbing rights destroying cynicmaking force id
agree  but does politics really kill

im bitter atm  two reasons mostly
 i was listening to what i heard being the first amendment
foundation on npr releasing a poll noting that their
veryunscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first
amendment goes too far   and their quote was  in  but im finding
sources of  in  of the population dont even know what rights are
guaranteed in the first amendment

 i have a paper due that will make or break my law school career  i
hate being a forced sheep

baaaa
