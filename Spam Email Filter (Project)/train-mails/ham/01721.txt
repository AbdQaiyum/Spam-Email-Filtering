 one effect of getting rid of mincount is that it latches on more
 strongly to rare clues now and those can be unique to the corpus
 trained on eg one trained ham says gryndlplyx and a followup
 new ham quotes it

this may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure  in real life msgs
come ordered in time  say theres a thread that spans n messages on clpy
in our testing setup well train on a random sampling throughout its whole
lifetime and test likewise  new ham in the middle of this thread gets
benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and after
it in real life  its quite plausible that the fp rate would rise without
this effect in real life at any given time some number of ham threads will
just be starting their lives and if theyre at all unusual the trained data
will know little to nothing about them
