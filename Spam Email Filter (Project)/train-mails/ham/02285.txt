anil dash discovers that the tmobile sidekicks webbrowser is pretty 
arbitrary in which pages it will load and which pages it will throw up its 
hands at 

    so i decided i was going to modify my page to conform to your browsers 
    idiocy i went looking for technical docs on what you do to mangle web 
    pages none i went looking for a desktop emulator that i could run to 
    simulate your device on my computer none i went looking to see an 
    acknowledgement of the shortcomings of your device indicating that the 
    situation would be improved none  

link discuss thanks joe
