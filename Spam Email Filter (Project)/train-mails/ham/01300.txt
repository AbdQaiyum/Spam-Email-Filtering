you can also install the xmms plugin
seems to make my xmms segfault on exit
hmmm but maybe its another plugin to listen to your good ol mp
files thats it

ive an xmms alsa module ive been using for a while now at
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaxmmscvsaapirpm
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaxmmscvsaapsrcrpm
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaxmmscvsspec

also there is alsaplayer rpms there too
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaplayeraapirpm
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaplayeraapirpm
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaplayeraapsrcrpm
httpwwwdudexnetrpmsalsaplayerspec

good luck both were build on an rh  box with errata current as of the date of
the build im running null rh beta now and i recall that alsaxmms still works i
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a rebuild

as an aside alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app ive been packaging
for many releases now

ive scripted the alsaxmms cvs build so its easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on null


thats angle as in geometry
