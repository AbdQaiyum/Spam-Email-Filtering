 i may be dense but why would anyone want to utilize habeus  to me
 it looks like a potential backdoor to anyones defenses against spam

 if i were a spammer id simply set up a server send out my spam with
 the habeus headers and continue till i was reasonably certain id been
 reported  then id simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a
 different ip  as long as no one can establish my connection to the
 web sites my spam is directing people to im home free

here is the bug i opened

  httpwwwhughesfamilyorgbugzillashowbugcgiid

rbls have the same problem but there is no negative rbl header rule
with a  score that can be forged so the problem is unique to habeas

 since i can set up spamassassin to i dont lose any email what do i
 gain by making it easier for spam to get through

my primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was
not determined empirically  i am also concerned that it was added after
the rules freeze that such a major change was not discussed in advance
etc

theres also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce fps  people
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesnt look like spam im not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering
