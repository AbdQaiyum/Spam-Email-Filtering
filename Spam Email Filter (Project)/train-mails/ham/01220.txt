     yeah i need to work this out too i just learned my lesson about
     living on the bleeding edge lesson learned  no more ximian under
     any circumstances  man that was annoying

we all learned that sooner or later right when i got down to that myself
is when i started redhataldilorg now known as freshrpmsnet 

     anyway i have returned to redhat  on my root filesystem saved my
     home directories music and games on other partitions and while i
     have the  stuff in the list everything i want to upgrade requires
      rpms
 
     im not opposed to this but apt is  aptget distupgrade dumps
     core

strange
anyway although id easily recommend upgrading x to  using apt i
wouldnt for x to  as they are c binary incompatible and apt is
entirely written in c and dynamically linked 

still that doesnt explain a core dump 

     whats the inside secret here or do i just start searching mirrors
     for the iso and get over it

why search theres more than enough to choose from here
