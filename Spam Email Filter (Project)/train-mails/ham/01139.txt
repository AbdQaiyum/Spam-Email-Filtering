  paul so you dont really need the unseen window unless youre
  paul using more sequences than just unseen

i use a virtual window manager and keep the main exmh window and 
the detached folder list on one virtual desktop but the unseen 
window is set to show on all desktops

got no help for the problems but just pointing out why some of 
us find the unseen window invaluable
