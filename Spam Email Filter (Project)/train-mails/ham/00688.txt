 cool  i wasnt aware that the us had lifted its population out
 of poverty when did this happen i wonder where the media gets the
 idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening

all the world loves a smartass



seriously look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
this continent before the europeans got here look at it now even
for descendants of the original inhabitants even for the descendents
of slaves who were brought here by force

more stuff cheaper thats progress

poverty of course is not relative its absolute disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it

its like saying that groups have rights when in truth only
individuals do like group rights disparity in wealth is
statistical sophistry


besides even if you cant help the distribution industrial wealth
is almost always transitory and so is relative poverty even when
there are no confiscatory deathtaxes the th anniversary forbes
 just came out and only a few tens of people are still there
since  a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth income and inheritance than we do now more to the point
theyre nowhere near the top

ill take those odds it is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself
in the form of government regulation confiscatory taxes legislated
monopoly corporate welfare nonprofit neoaristocratic tax dodges
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress like
what happened in fabianera britain or s usa

in fact it is in countries where wealth is the most unfairly
distributed that you get the most improvement in the general 
economic  welfare more stuff cheaper fewer people dying more
people living longer

ill take those odds as well people take greater risks when the
returns are higher improving the lot of us all as a result
