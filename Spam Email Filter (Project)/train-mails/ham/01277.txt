 ive never heard of any cdrom or dvdrom drive having problems with
 dma although there probably is since red hat decided to default
 disabling it a few releases back 

when i worked as a pc repair tech for a computer store chain i did
run across quite a few dvd drives that would lock up if dma was
enabled  its more of a chipsetdrive problem than a drive by itself
