 the above was something along the lines i was attempting once i 
 realised it was a straight swap but i couldnt get awks gensub to 
 insert the x for s and s

perls pack would do the job

  ps the late reply is because the footer on the original mail if
  you received this mail in error yadda yadda got caught in my
  spam filter and ended up in my junkmail directory
 
 might not have been the footer  check my headers 

actually it was worse  a bodycheck showed up a remove url i
need a new spam filter but i want to be able to process false
positives rather than dump them

cheers
