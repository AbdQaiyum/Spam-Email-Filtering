the default score for bondedsendercertified domains is  but i do not
believe they should be trusted and encourage you to change the default

 i have been spammed by their customers
 there is no documentation on their website about how i can complain about
  this and have their customers financially penalized for sending me unsolicited
  mail
 what proof do any of us have that they really even do anything about it
  their contract is with their customers not with us

this is a scam  dont trust them
