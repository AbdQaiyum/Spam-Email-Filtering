 ok im upgrading vorbis on my machine and im getting
 the following
 
  rpm u libvorbis vorbistoolsirpm
 error failed dependencies
 	libvorbisfileso   is needed by sdlmixer
 	libvorbisfileso   is needed by xmms
 	libvorbisfileso   is needed by tuxracer
 
 this is because the new libvorbisrpm only has libvorbisfileso
 so is this a problem in the other packages depending on
 a specific version libvorbisfileso rather than on the
 generic libvorbisso 

 this is a pain 

 the only way you can resolve this to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one remove the old one then do

 rpm uvh libvorbis

 rpm then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time
and does so why you cant do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me
