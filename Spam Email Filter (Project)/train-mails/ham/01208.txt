 is it possible to use new apt to do null to rh upgrade

it might be dont think anyone tried it yet

 even if its possible are there good reasons why maybe i should not do it and
 just use the rh isos i dont think rh will upgrade from null maybe update
 will

yes 

first off redhat does not support upgrading from betas to the released 
version  that doesnt mean it cant work it means nobody tried it they 
sure didnt test it or fix anything to make it work and youre on your 
own

second historically a new  numbers mostly means so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway  so historically most users installing a  release do this 
from scratch anyway doing upgrades throughout xxy

if you want to avoid problems bite the bullet and reinstall
