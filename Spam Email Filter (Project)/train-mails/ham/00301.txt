 if the creator didnt say you could have it without paying its theft
so
 simple hell thats even in all the major holy books

ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
ten commandments  it seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit
too

in particular there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about man stealing  selling a free man into
slavery  certainly the us southerners were particularly sensitive to
the term man stealer in a way i didnt understand

yep i know he said all holy books  no i dont know if this site was
blowing hot air  it just read like someone had done their homework
