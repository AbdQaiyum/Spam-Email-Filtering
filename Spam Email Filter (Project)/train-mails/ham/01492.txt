v some of my security violations and unusual system events are being 
v tagged as spam by spamassassin how do i get sa to ignore these messages

whitelists  you really have to white list any message source that
discusses or is used to report spam else the reports will be marked
as spam given that they have the spam indicators in them usually

this is the only whitelisting i use
