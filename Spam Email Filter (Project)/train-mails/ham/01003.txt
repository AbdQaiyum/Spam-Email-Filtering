   when i receive a gpg encrypted message and it asks me for a passphrase 
 it
   first tries to ask me via the tty under which exmh is running it tells 

hmm ive seen the opposite issue  if i go to send a signed message
sometimes exmh will put up the dialog box but fail to set keyboard focus
there so no passphrase can be entered  of course hitting return doesnt
work so you need to click the ok box at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasnt entered doesnt work and asks again this time with
proper focus set

i suspect some variablecodepath is getting hosed for the focus or possibly
some borkedness with notty andor statusfd flags to gnupg
