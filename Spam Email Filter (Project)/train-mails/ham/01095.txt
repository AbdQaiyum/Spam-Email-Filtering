   i have the following openssl packages installed
  
  snip
  opensslperlb
  opensslb
  opensslaa
  openssldevelb
  snip
  
  the openssla package should provide the openssla compatibility
  but apt doesnt think so 
 
 i believe thats just a matter of string parsing if someone were to fix
 the openssh package removing the explicit requires i believe the
 automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
 install i havent met an openssh like that and in worst case ive had 
 different openssl libraries wtf cant they just bump a major version if
 its incompatible

strange all my openssh packages dont explicitly requires a version of
openssl what version of openssh do you have is it an official red hat
package i suppose it isnt and using red hats rpms will solve your
problem

what you need to know for openssl is 
b is libcryptoso and libsslso
  is libcryptoso and libsslso
b is libcryptoso and libsslso

now in all red hat packages ive seen so far the only dependency is on
those files and not on openssl  version
