 heres a fix that i think will make a real difference
 
 ftocshowsequences needs to be able to be called with an optional
 list of msgids 
 to update and if its called that way it only removes or adds tags
 for those 
 messages  then in places like msgchange we only update the
 messages which have
 changed
 
 also a separate ftocshowsequence function which only updates the
 display of 
 one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of
 msgids
   
 in a place like msgchange it would only need to update the cur
 sequence
 
 if nobody else gets to it ill do this when i get back

 i just checked this in  let me know if it helps

 chris
