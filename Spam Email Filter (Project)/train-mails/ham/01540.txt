 spamassassin  has been tossing my daily logwatch  reports into 
 the spam bucket  a recent one generated the folowing hits 

fixed in cvs i think or at least my logwatches get through fine  if it
is not fixed in cvs then report it using the correct bugreporting
procedure

     open a bugzilla bug httpbugzillaspamassassinorg

     attach a sample mail message as an attachment with all
    headers intact
