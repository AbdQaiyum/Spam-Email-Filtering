  but as its the primary mailer i use you can be sure that as soon
  as its updated to  ill update my build 
 
 it got updated 

so did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning 
one drawback  they changed from pspell to aspell apparently and it
requires aspell   which isnt even in rawhide so spell checking is
disabled for now until i take a decision about it 

if i build recent aspell packages they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next red hat linux release the final version of the limbos and
null betas which is maybe not really desired ill probably test and
see

ps the spec file was massively updated and the with  without options
that can be used to rebuild the source packages are now listed in the
description
