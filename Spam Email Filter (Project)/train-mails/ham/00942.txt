i got to see powell talk in march  at the beginning of his
reign at the fcc  he said they were going to take a real
hands off approach so its funny that they would blame
the regulators for causing the collapse  one thing he did
get right is that he wasnt worried that the us was behind
europe in the wireless licensing spectrum  this is something
very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
very little benefit  his legacy wasis supposed to be
rethinking the fccs role to stay out of the way in this
period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
didnt want the government forcing business models onto
the private sector

his full transcript is here   interestingly enough i
got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
ctia las vegas keynote series of speakers  clay and
i hoped a flight out of ontario to las vegas to do demo support
for craig barrett   his message was that theres no difference
between wired and wireless internetits all the same thing
instead of scalable networks we should be thinking about scalable
content  using magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
the content scaling back for each target platform

the best part of the whole trip wasnt hobnobbing at all
but really the fact that the venetian had ran out of rooms
they decided to put us up in one of their night high
roller rooms  they put clay in one and me in another
the venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
anywhere but these ones were bigger than my whole house

 i cant believe i actually read a laughoutloud funny profile of the 
 fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes 
 recommended a fine explanation of michael powells extraordinary 
 equivocation
 
 on the other hand i can also agree with werbachs werblog entry rohit
 
 a trip to fcc world

 nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc 
 chairman michael powell  its one of the first articles ive seen 
 that captures some of powells real personality and the way hes 
 viewed in washington  unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing 
 conventional political wisdom  after describing how powell isnt 
 really a firebreathing ideological conservative he concludes that 
 in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies 
 while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants  i know thats not 
 how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many 
 issues i think hes right to resist the old dichotomy

 the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who 
 went through it  the disaster wasnt the regulators fault as some 
 conservatives argue  but something clearly went horribly wrong and 
 policymakers should learn from that experience  contrary to lemanns 
 speculation the upstart carriers wont be successful in a gore 
 administration because its too late  virtually all of them are 
 dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the 
 foreseeable future  some may survive but as small players rather 
 than worlddominators 

 the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is 
 old news  the next important battle in telecom will be between those 
 who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use 
 different models entirely  thats why open broadband networks and 
 open spectrum are so important  whatever the regulatory environment 
 there is going to be consolidation in telecom  those left out in that 
 consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into 
 the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will 
 cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further 
 pressure for alternatives 

 lemann is right that policymaking looks much drier and more ambiguous 
 on the ground than through the lens of history  but hes wrong in 
 thinking that telecoms future will be something like its past

 the chairman   
 by nicholas lemann
 hes the other powell and no one is sure what hes up to
 new yorker october  
 
 last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first 
 fairly serious americanhistory course indignantly reported that the 
 whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg 
 and the declaration of independence and the selmatomontgomery march 
 just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his 
 class had got up to the eighteenforties what i expected was a big 
 beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and indeed 
 there was some of that but the main difference between my sons text 
 and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
 decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american 
 history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
 reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping 
 for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
 of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
 become possible to see the federal governments main function as 
 responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice 
 instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests
 
 even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
 speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what youd find 
 is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so 
 much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real 
 estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which 
 this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
 commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them its 
 an insiders game less because the players are secretive than because 
 the public and the pressencouraged by the players who speak in jargon
 cant get themselves interested
 
 one corner of washington might be called fcc world for the federal 
 communications commission fcc world has perhaps five thousand 
 denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate 
 commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that 
 the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription 
 price  a year and every year around christmastime they 
 grumblingly attend the chairmans dinner at a washington hotel where 
 the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly selfdeprecating 
 comedy routine by the commissions chairman
 
 of all the federal agencies and commissions the fcc is the one that 
 americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with 
 a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
 american economy as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone 
 and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now 
 fcc world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather 
 because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
 corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies 
 regulated by the fcc qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing 
 among others are or were part of fcc world aol time warner is 
 part of fcc world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney 
 analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the 
 embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of fcc world in the 
 past two years companies belonging to fcc world have lost trillions 
 of dollars in stockmarket valuation and have collectively served as a 
 dead weight pulling down the entire stock market
 
 this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
 of the fcc has been circulating widely within fcc world it evokes 
 fcc worlds feverish mood the fcc is fiddling while rome burns 
 and suggests why nobody besides residents of fcc world has thought of 
 the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i 
 just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to 
 enter all ld markets within twelve months while losing virtually no 
 residential customers to attackers since  and suffering about  
 market share loss in business lines to clecs its a lot easier to 
 think about evil ceos than to decipher that
 
 
 even in good times fcc world pays obsessive attention to the 
 commissions chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially 
 intense and when the chairman is a celebrity fcc world devotes 
 itself to fulltime chairmanwatching the current chairman michael 
 powell is a celebrity at least by governmentofficial standards 
 because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state 
 unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which 
 generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about 
 who he really is and what hes really up to powell is young to be the 
 head of a federal agencyhe is thirtynineand genially charming 
 everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years 
 one of the fccs five commissioners not only is he fluent in the 
 fccs incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the 
 arcane details of communications policy hes always saying that hes an 
 avid moderate and yet he has a rageinciting quality one of his 
 predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell 
 to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america 
 calls him radical and extreme just as often as hes accused of being 
 a rightwing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically 
 cautious it aint about singing kumbayah around the campfire 
 another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an 
 answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate 
 subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the 
 subcommittees chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated 
 him you dont care about these regulations hollings said you dont 
 care about the law or what congress sets down    thats the 
 fundamental thats the misgiving i have of your administration over 
 there it just is amazing to me you just pellmell down the road and 
 seem to not care at all i think youd be a wonderful executive 
 vicepresident of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a 
 regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job
 
 extremely powell said with an amiable smile
 
 
 one cannot understand powells maddening effect at least on democrats 
 and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose 
 of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the fcc was 
 created by congress in  but it existed in prototype well before the 
 new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
 cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure 
 that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its 
 other original function was preventing american telephone  telegraph 
 the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers 
 unfairly over the decades as fcc world grew up into a comfortable 
 wellestablished place the fcc segued into the role of industrial 
 supervisionits real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition 
 among communications companies so that it didnt become too bloody by 
 artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business 
 in addition to looking out for the publics interest the commission 
 more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many 
 of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
 terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank 
 president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster 
 according to an ofttold fcc world anecdote president clinton once 
 blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
 in the same city because he said if the soandso who owned the 
 anticlinton little rock democratgazette had owned the leading tv 
 station in little rock too clinton would never have become president
 
 
 fcc world may have been con tentious but it was settled too 
 because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
 niches for themselves then in the nineteeneighties the successful 
 breakup of at  tby far the biggest and most important company the 
 commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of 
 selfconfidence onto the consciousness of fcc world a generation 
 ago for most americans there was one local phone company one 
 longdistance company and one company that manufactured telephones 
 which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same 
 company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the 
 midnineteennineties there were a dozen economically viable local 
 phone companies a handful of national longdistance companies competing 
 to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores 
 everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand 
 millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
 telephone lines at  t had argued for years that it was a natural 
 monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total 
 control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period 
 the fcc had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
 and the internet it was the dream of federalagency success come true 
 consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more 
 prosperous too
 
 the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of  
 one of those massive endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which 
 most people outside fcc world probably felt it was safe to ignore 
 although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
 modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interestgroup 
 bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers 
 as baby bells and to fcc world as arbocks the pronounced version 
 of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to 
 offer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance 
 companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
 customers consumers would win because for the first time they would 
 get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
 competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and 
 economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by 
 vicepresident gore were just as important democrats saw the act as 
 helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that 
 brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of 
 jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose 
 beneficiaries might become the partys new contributor base clintons 
 slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to 
 the twentyfirst century which like all clinton slogans artfully 
 sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical 
 correlates of the telecom act and gores cruise to the presidency was 
 supposed to be powered substantially by the acts success
 
 the fcc had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich 
 aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like 
 all important interest groups they work with both parties they 
 immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new 
 competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through 
 rulemaking enforcement and litigation the fcc then headed by 
 reed hundt who was gores classmate at st albans was supposed to keep 
 the arbocks in their cages so that not only longdistance companies 
 like at  t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new 
 companies seelecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive 
 local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory 
 equivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have 
 access to the arbocks switching equipment the arbock wont give the 
 seeleck a key to the room where its kept so the seeleck asks the 
 fcc to rule that the arbock has to give it the key
 
 partly because hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that 
 he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming 
 condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the 
 seeleckscompanies with names like winstar covad and teligentand 
 into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related 
 technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom 
 boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks 
 and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests 
 of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundts 
 former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make 
 sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up
 
 
 the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the 
 boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more 
 startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies 
 time warner and aol decided to throw in together and at  t and 
 comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys 
 believed that their selfdealing stockoverselling and creative 
 accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating
 
 by the time the outcome of the  presidential election had been 
 determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the 
 chairmanship of the fcc remained one of the best jobs in terms of 
 influence and visibility available to a career government regulator 
 three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner 
 harold furchtgottroth the farthesttotheright commissioner and 
 patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as 
 such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most 
 powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the ceo of 
 sbc communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant 
 that the arbocks didnt want wood as head of the fcc because he 
 might be too proseeleck wood is now the head of the federal energy 
 regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
 wasnt as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative 
 movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
 furchtgottroth
 
 powell did this deftly for example in december of  he appeared 
 before a conservative group called the progress  freedom foundation and 
 gave a very michael powell speechwhimsical intellectual and 
 freeassociative biblical history joseph schumpeter moores lawthat 
 began by making fun of the idea that the fcc should try to keep new 
 telecom companies alive in the wake of the  act the fcc is 
 often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the 
 whos down in whoville who feast on whopudding and rare whoroast 
 beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
 deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the acts 
 fertile soil but this feast the fcc grinch did not like in the 
 least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became 
 chairman he didnt expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as 
 part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
 of the bush administration
 
 twenty months into the administration nearly all the seelecks are dead 
 or dying nearly all longdistance companies not just worldcom are in 
 serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite 
 companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically 
 concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing 
 companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in 
 good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
 companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the 
 financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications 
 industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells 
 wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and 
 if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national 
 duopoly in local service verizon in the east and sbc in the west 
 and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the 
 poor health of the longdistance companies
 
 the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
 companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they 
 dont have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
 fully control what material they allow to enter peoples homes as part 
 of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the  
 telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
 significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of 
 radiostation owners in the united states has been cut by twentyfive 
 per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news 
 programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary 
 of viacom
 
 in this situation many democrats and liberals think the fcc should 
 be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation springing to the 
 rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try 
 to breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies it should 
 disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the 
 forces of concentration it should use the governments money and muscle 
 to get new technologyespecially fast internet connectionsinto the 
 homes of people who cant afford it at current market prices an 
 analogy that a lot of people in fcc world make is between telecom and 
 the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush 
 people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush 
 people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many 
 expectations and stirred too many passions
 
 but michael powells fcc has not been hyperactive powell has been 
 conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
 fcc and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him 
 signals in midseptember powell finally initiated a formal review of 
 the fccs limits on media concentration this doesnt mean he has 
 been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further 
 infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
 the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
 fcc world really make sense while giving the impression that hes 
 having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference 
 when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital 
 dividethat is economic inequality in access to the internethe said 
 you know i think there is a mercedes divide id like to have one and 
 i cant afford one at the national cable  telecommunications 
 association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of 
 tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
 somersault
 
 
 not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the fcc until 
  when the commission moved to a new building in southwest 
 washington near the citys openair fish market fcc world was at 
 the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody 
 else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the fcc building 
 looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park 
 even the chairmans suite though large is beige carpeted and 
 fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and 
 walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a 
 jeep accident in germany in  when he was an army officer because 
 of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he 
 became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly 
 the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
 the market before the factprophylactically as he likes to sayshould 
 wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
 litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and 
 then became a protg of joel klein the head of the antitrust division 
 of the clinton justice department and the man who led the governments 
 legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of 
 the new york publicschool system it testifies to powells political 
 skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush 
 administration who not only served in the clinton administration but 
 also maintains close ties to bushs nemesis senator john mccain of 
 arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his 
 enduring love of law schoolits sort of like a lawschool study 
 session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to 
 confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law 
 students summer interns at the commission whom hed invited to sit in
 
 i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
 of the fcc for example could private companies have apportioned the 
 airwaves among themselves without the government being involved
 
 i think well never know powell said i dont think its an 
 automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably 
 the best analogue we dont seize all the land in the united states and 
 say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor 
 puts a fence one foot onto my property line theres a whole body of law 
 about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if 
 a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company its a 
 similar proposition there are scholars who argueindeed the famous 
 ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about thisthat 
 spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds 
 of ways that were accustomed to
 
 talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he 
 doesnt seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he 
 slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in 
 ironic air quotes hes like your libertarian friend in college who 
 enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
 about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
 sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he 
 thought his predecessors excitement about the  telecommunications 
 act had been excessive
 
 i would start with a caveat powell said look i cant fault those 
 judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought 
 they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities 
 but frankly ive always been a little bit critical first of all 
 anybody who works with the act knows that it doesnt come anywhere close 
 to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president 
 on down about the kinds of things its going to open up i mean i 
 dont know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions 
 or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that 
 were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts 
 reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions 
 but nonetheless there was a rising dotcom excitement and an internet 
 excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it 
 certainly was
 
 but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of 
 expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the 
 economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically 
 exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission by 
 politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a 
 gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones 
 that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to 
 see numbers go up on the board
 
 powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act  
 i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see 
 thirtypercent market share fiftypercent market share i want the 
 bells to bleed then well know weve succeeded  now powell returned 
 to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly 
 unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while theyre 
 there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and 
 the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking theres no 
 question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much 
 debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model
 
 how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have 
 chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were 
 slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system 
 powell said money chased what seemed like governmentpromised 
 opportunity the problem with that is theres a morning after and were 
 in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this 
 debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some 
 ways for shortterm gain we paid a price in longterm stability
 
 powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
 had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldnt have 
 every home in america with competitive choice yetbut we dont anyway i 
 dont think its the remonopolization of telephone service i dont buy 
 that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldnt the 
 part of the story that didnt materialize was that people thought so 
 would mci worldcom and sprint
 
 other local phone companies he added hadnt materialized as viable 
 businesses either and they never might everybodys always saying 
 the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the storys 
 quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six 
 years to give them a chance conditions dont get that good except once 
 every thirty years and it didnt happen so whatever the reason were 
 looking at a worldcom thats teetering were looking at a longdistance 
 business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base at  t is 
 breaking itself up sprint has struggled
 
 could the fcc have done anything to make the longdistance companies 
 stronger at the fcc i think ill just be blunt my political 
 answer yes theres all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
 to help but i cant find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere 
 i cant mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an sec 
 investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i dont have 
 those kinds of levers i dont know whether anybody does at some point 
 companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
 dying powell couldnt have made it much clearer that he doesnt think 
 its his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has 
 demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
 gesturesin august for example five months after disbanding the 
 fccs accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was 
 appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
 communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding 
 out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities 
 and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
 up the telecom industry
 
 i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one 
 company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
 service yes he said it concerns us that theres one of each of 
 those things but lets not diminish the importance of there being one 
 of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications 
 capabilities even if they arent direct analogues of each other 
 anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to 
 provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will 
 provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice 
 so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question 
 is does it stay that way
 
 the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
 information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that 
 people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration 
 which distorts markets if this were just economics its easy if you 
 were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we 
 know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a 
 markets too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is 
 other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take 
 the question of if everybodys controlling what you see the assumption 
 there is that somehow therell be this viewpoint a monolithic 
 viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you wont get diversity i 
 think thats a possibility i dont think its nearly the possibility 
 thats ascribed to it sometimes
 
 powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
 parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the 
 same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh 
 exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off 
 the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias 
 and then we have policies likehere his tone went from ironic to 
 sarcasticthe fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis 
 of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed 
 and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
 fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out
 
 
 fcc world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he 
 cant make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
 he regulatesso he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the 
 market in order to buy himself time another is that hes carrying 
 water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is 
 planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed 
 attorney general in a second bush term and doesnt want to do anything 
 at the fcc that would diminish his chances another is that hes 
 waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action 
 so that he doesnt wind up going first and getting caught in the 
 crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
 networks in fcc world this is known as the powell doctrine of 
 telecom after colin powells idea that the united states should never 
 commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force 
 and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he 
 says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and 
 irreversible and more concentration would be just fine
 
 this is why elections matter reed hundt who isnt happy about what 
 has become of his telecom act told me its true that the fccmuch 
 more than say the war in afghanistanis a case in which a gore 
 administration would be acting quite differently from the bush 
 administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but 
 theres no question whether communications companies have noticed the 
 arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
 have done if gore had won next election theyll help the party that 
 helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the 
 arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivalsthe 
 longdistance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their
