 except for  thing defanged mime messages  thats a big problem
 but if you didnt just remove the headers and instead reverted
 back to the xspamprev versions itd moreorless work
 
 btw fixed the downloads page 

check now undefangs mime  it was screwing up some of my masscheck
results where samarkup was present yes

if there ever was a warning about samarkup in masscheck it never
worked for me
