remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world as 
several people have already noted google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update the weblogging community was hit hard for instance i used 
to be the  mark i am now  the changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena explicitly selling ads based on pagerank and 
google bombing 

specifically google is now apparently crosschecking link text with the linked 
site and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site this all but kills off google bombing searching for go to hell
 no longer takes you to microsoftcom searching for talentless hack 
no longer finds ohmessylifecom although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the google bombing no definitive word yet on 
whether google is actively penalizing such sites 

unfortunately the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage apparently coming down hardest on 
mediumtolarge sites that had previously been doing everything right as far 
as page structure link structure accessibility and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site the webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation 

 new update pagerank death 
 september  google update discussion  part  
 lets find out what happened  sept  update  pt  

side note amongst the confusion it has been suggested that google is no 
longer indexing alt text in images i can confirm that this is absolutely 
false searching diveintomarkorg for gimli finds my entry of july 
 where gimli is mentioned only in the alt text of an image 

regardless googles search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas the forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites doorway pages and obvious cloaking attempts which google used to be so 
good at filtering out are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords theyre 
tracking so i tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results it 
didnt take long 

 searching for reservation hotel brings up an empty subpage of a 
hotel reservation company in italy as the first result this seems 
unhelpful and unlikely to be relevant to the average usbased consumer and 
google absolutely knows im in the us based on my ip address 
 searching for news observer nc the news  observer is a raleigh nc 
newspaper does find the news  observer but it also finds an internet 
betting spam page at  and a nonexistent page at  
 searching for eminem gives us two generic portal pages a nonexistent 
site and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
i am not making this up and this is just on the first page good thing i 
didnt care that much about eminem to begin with because google just isnt 
that helpful 

many people in the webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that allthewebcom
 has better search results overall just as a single comparison their 
results for eminem do appear to be much more relevant is this the 
beginning of the end of googles reign
