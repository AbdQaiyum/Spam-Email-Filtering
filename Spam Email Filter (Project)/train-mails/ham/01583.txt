i have a spamdspamcrazordcc setup

my razor logs are full of

sep   check   bootup logging initiated 
logdebuglevel to filehomeomegarazorrazoragentlog
sep   check   mail  is not known spam

the problem is that all the entries show is not known spam  i cant believe 
im that lucky  so how do i test to see that my razor installation is 
working properly  ive been up to my ears in documentation for the past few 
days so if the reference is easy just point me to it  otherwise a brief 
hint on how to would be appreciated
