is there a way to do a global sort command heres the situation i like to 
sort by date every folder im cleaning up my inbox from most recent to oldest 
since i find this direction most efficient i guess because it helps me 
recognize the significance of individual old messages but this adds messages 
to my other folders in the wrong order when im done id like to resort all 
the folders ive changed
