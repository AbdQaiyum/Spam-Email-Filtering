 the problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
 nowadays that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
 political rallies that you dont agree with has become
 common practice  the courts have constantly ruled
 that there are some restrictions on the first amendment
 they teach you that your very first year of law school


i dont think politics is any muddier people are becoming increasingly
unethical its a breakdown in home training
