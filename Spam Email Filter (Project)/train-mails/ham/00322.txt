so imo its the corruption thats the problem and corruption 
regulation and corruption  socialism   also overpopulation is really
a symptom of that

the more opportunity for corruption if a corporation is corrupt
there are generally absent more government intervention
alternatives with bureacracy that is more difficult one generally
most uproot oneself and move
