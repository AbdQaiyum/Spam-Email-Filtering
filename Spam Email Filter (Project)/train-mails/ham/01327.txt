 just because its documented doesnt mean its a good thing

 i work for an isp  we provide spamassassin to our customers  i got email
 today from a support tech saying that spamassassin t reports that a
 message is probably spam even when its not and why is this and can we
 change it  i thought about why it is and the only answer i could come up
 with was it was easier for the programmer that way  thats an answer i
 guess but her point was that this is going to generate support calls and
 support calls cost us time and money

 why would a customer use spamassassin t without understanding what it does
