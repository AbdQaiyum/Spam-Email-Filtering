   restarting exmh was necessary

probably not   next time try clicking on the folder name in the
sequences window for the sequence   that is request that sequence
be the one displayed in the ftoc   if the sequence doesnt exist
it will be cleaned up then

perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well but this
is effective enough
