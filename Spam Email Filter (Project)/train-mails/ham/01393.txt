 btw i tried tweaking some of the scores that lintrules complained about
 being negative when they shouldnt be and it ruined the results  its
 worth handtweaking a bit but in some cases theres counterintuitive
 combinatorial effects like the above so be careful when tweaking run
 a logstoc  evolve c to check the new hitrates afterwards

my tendency is to say that we shouldnt tweak at all
