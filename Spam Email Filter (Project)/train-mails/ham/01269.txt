hi

in my build scripts i have problems with some of the kernel packages

for kernelsources i get 

package kernelsource is a virtual package provided by
  kernelsource 
  kernelsource 

on running aptget install kernelsource

now first of all this doesnt really tell me what the two options are 
second is there some way i can tell aptget to install either  this is 
done from automatic build scripts so id like it to proceed anyway

thanks
thomas
