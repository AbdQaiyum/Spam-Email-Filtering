this is possible however using sa as a block criteria is not recommended 
sa does have a very realistic chance of mismarking mail so using it as an 
autodelete function is at best extraordinarily foolish


however heres what the procmail rule will look like dug up from an old 
post to this list by steve thomas

in your procmailrc file


 xspamstatus yes
devnull


do not do this youll throw out a lot of legitimate messages over time

instead do what the docs suggest and put them into a separate mail folder


 xspamstatus yes
maildirspam
