 well ive figured out the problem  i guess you could say its an alsa 
 bug  when one configures using withcardsall alsa blindly turns 
 on the various configsndusb macros even if configusb is not 
 actually set

 matthias would you please consider hooking up this patch in your 
 alsadriverspec  it can be added in the obvious manner
 
 i suppose i should send this along to the alsa developers as well  for 
 them ill produce a proper patch that makes the fix in acincludem 
   or is someone else on this list already part of the alsa developer 
 community and willing to shepherd this through for me

not me but imho its kind of offtopic to put it in freshrpmsnet rpms 
upstream is the way to go
