hi all
does anyone know how to set up dual keyboardsone is actually a standalone
keypad
both keyboards have ps connections and i want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device  then if the other keyboard is plugged in that
should take over
possible  any possible hacks
  

get a keyboard switch  i think even viking direct and maplin stock them
