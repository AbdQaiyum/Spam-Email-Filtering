i received some feedback in email from several of you actually regarding my 
earlier blog about the parents television council which recently published 
a report in which they labeled buffy as the worst show on television for 
children let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much

buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under  and a game like 
gta is as well the ptc however has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games there is 
a belief on the part of the ptc that the hour from pm the first hour of 
primetime must be designated a family hour and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time i dont believe that its the networks responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television the 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut some are familyoriented and 
some arent there is however no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch tv together during this hour

it should be the parents responsibility to police a childs television 
viewing if you dont want your kids watching buffy the vampire slayer then 
dont let them but dont campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you dont like its content if you dont think a show is appropriate dont let 
your kids watch it

the ptc also seems to find shows offensive that are familyoriented an example 
of one such show is malcolm in the middle i would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids apparently the only shows that the ptc deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultraconservative agenda even then i wouldnt really mind but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous
