 so after shutting off the water and mopping up i was left to ponder what
 are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
 bowl in the absence of any visible stressors like someone striking it with
 a sledgehammer we hadnt done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent

all it takes is an overtorqued nut eg at the water intake entrance
to stress the porcelain and youve got a time bomb waiting to go off
of course if youre lucky youll overtorque it enough that the tank
will break right away while you still have the water intake shut off
