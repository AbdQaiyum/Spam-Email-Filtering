 it runs solaris  x as standard
 i was joking al

and will run solaris  when sun catch up with the x drivers and kernel

although dont hold your breath for the free dvd it will never come

spot the person who applied for the free solaris  dvd only to be told
three months later it is no longer availablemutter

fwiw solaris and linux seem to be getting closer all the time i can no
longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other expect red
hat solaris  any time now grin
