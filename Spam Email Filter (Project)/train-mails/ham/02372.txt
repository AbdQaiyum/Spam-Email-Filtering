after discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa steven 
hackers levy interviewed lawmen academics and wifi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points 

    i downloaded my mail and checked media news on the web when i confessed 
    this to fbi agent bill shore he spared the handcuffs the fbi wouldnt 
    waste resources on that he sniffed now i know that if it did it would 
    be hard to argue that i broke a law whats more i certainly didnt feel 
    illegal becauseand this is the point of all that wardriving and 
    chalking and nodestumblingwhen you get used to wireless the experience 
    feels more and more like a godgiven right one day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable  

link discuss thanks steven
