 ive rebuilt a new alsaplayer package based on angles one

cool one less package to maintain 

one interesting thing about alsaplayer is that redhats xmms package in rh will
probably not play mp files but alsaplayer does play mps out of the box

also they are developing rapidly in their cvs and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool but i have no idea when it will be ready


thats angle as in geometry
