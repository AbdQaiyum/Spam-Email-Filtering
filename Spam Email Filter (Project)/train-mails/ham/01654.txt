    ns writing an imap server is a nontrivial task

thats what ive been told by everyone ive talked to whos actually
tried to write one
    
    ns alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and
    ns client that could be used to review additions to the training
    ns set  each day a few random spam and ham messages could be
    ns grabbed as candidates  someone would periodically startup the
    ns client review the candidates reclassify or remove any
    ns messages they dont like and add them to the training set

i think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham  i
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before theyre assumed to be ham
matched with a simple spam reporting scheme this could keep the
training up to date with little effort  ive sketched out an approach
a listserver like mailman could do along these lines and if i get some
free time ill hack something together

i like the idea of a pop proxy which is classifying messages as
theyre pulled from the server  the easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the pop proxy would periodically consult
