thanks brent now its clearer to me whats needed ive used the global
sort and j c lawrences rescan but there is still a vulnerability there
if i have an instance of exmh running the folder im visiting will have
its new correct xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when i switch
folders i can cron the sort and rescan process but i should kill running
exmhs first

best would be to have a button for global sort and update all scan caches
in the exmh more menu

  brent there is an update all scan caches menu entry that rescans your
  brent folders similar to the short scripts folks have shared around  it
  brent runs in the background
