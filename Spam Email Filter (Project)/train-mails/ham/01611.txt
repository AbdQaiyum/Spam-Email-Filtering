this is happening due to insufficient write access to the
razoragentlog file i was getting the same error but
only as a nonroot user  as a quick workaround you can do
chmod gow razoragentlog

in agentpm when then the logger object is created it
doesnt check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user then when a write attempt is made it bails out with
the unblessed reference error

hope that helps

 i just noticed the following log entries in my syslog with the latest
 spamassassin cvs set up using spamcspamd and razoragents 

 jul   timmy spamd razor check skipped no such file or
 directory cant call method log on unblessed reference at
 usrlocallibperlsiteperlrazorclientagentpm line 
 stdin line 

 i saw this after checking if my upgrade from razoragents  to  went
 okay but the problem is still there after downgrading back to   i
 dont really know when this started happening 

 any ideas on the problem
