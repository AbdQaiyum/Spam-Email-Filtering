mixed news from yesterdays heart checkup 

first i went seven minutes on the treadmill that was pretty good my heart 
was racing like it hadnt since i was in college they also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries theyre in the neck and supply my head 
with blood more good news there theyre clear free of plaque healthy not 
diseased so it appears i just have coronary artery disease not general 
artery disease thats good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick and not a whole lot they can do about it as they can with the 
heart 

now there was some notgood news a small part of my heart isnt working very 
well there are a few possible reasons for that some fixable some not i 
asked the doctor does this mean im going to die sooner and he said no does 
it mean i have to restrict what i do he said no so what does it mean really 
not much other than i should watch as before for recurring symptoms the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in june if they come back well do an 
angiogram and maybe an angioplasty but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small thats quite a relief i dont like the idea of part 
of my heart not working but what can you do about it
