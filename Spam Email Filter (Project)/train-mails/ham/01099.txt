  strange all my openssh packages dont explicitly requires a version

 opensshp
 
 i think that is directly from openssh site its from the rh  that i 
 upgraded to   doesnt ship with openssh 

that explains

 i probably should downgrade to the versoin rh provides except i cant do 
 that as i dont have physical access to that box and downgrading ssh 
 packages over ssh doesnt sound like a bright idea

well with  ive seen a few problems with doing that but as of 
its really wonderful ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
related packages while being connected through ssh well it works of
course if the connection cuts at that moment youre stuck but a simple
upgrade with official red hat packages also works like a charm
