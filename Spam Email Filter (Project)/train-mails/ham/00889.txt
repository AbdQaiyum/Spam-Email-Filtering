does anyone know what happened to vcard support in netscape mozilla 

 not there yet in mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine i 
presume

netscape messengermozilla have ldap ldif importexport but i cant 
find vcard or a reference to it anywhere  i like the netscapemozilla 
email client  i avoid lookout for at least two reasons windows only 
my main environment is linux with  on windows and security issues

now that ldap and the related dsml and dns srv record methods are 
becoming more popular is there a decline of vcard
is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
the two

ive brushed with directories in the past but im getting in deep along 
with more pki oriented focus  any wisdom would be appreciated  in 
particular im going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and 
win systems and integrating them with netscape messengermozilla and 
outlook

thanks
sdw
