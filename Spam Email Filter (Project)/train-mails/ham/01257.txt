 ive tried the without options but still end up with similar for the
 regular package
 
 	glut is needed by xinelibsfr

you need to install the glut package from red hat linux  and
glutdevel if you intend to recompile the source rpm

         aalib is needed by xinelibsfr
         lirc is needed by xinelibsfr
         libaaso is needed by xinelibsfr
         libglutso is needed by xinelibsfr

here you need both aalib and lirc from freshrpmsnet theyre small
they can be quite useful thats why ive compiled xine with them as a
default
you should be able to get rid of those two though by rebuilding the source
rpm otherwise its a bug in my packaging 
rpmbuild rebuild without aalib without lirc xinesrcrpm
