it will function as a router if that is what you wish

it even looks like the modems embedded os is some kind of linux being that
it has interesting interfaces like eth

i dont use it as a router though i just have it do the absolute minimum
dsl stuff and do all the really fun stuff like pppoe on my linux box

also the manual tells you what the default password is

dont forget to run pppoe over the alcatel speedtouch i as in my case you
have to have a bridge configured in the routermodems software
this lists your vci values etc


 also does anyone know if the highend speedtouch with
  ethernet ports can act as a full router or do i still
 need to run a pppoe stack on the linux box

 regards

 vin
