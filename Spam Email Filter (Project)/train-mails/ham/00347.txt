if we had more variety of franchise food than
the wendyskfcpizzahuttacobelltimhortons monopoly  the usa is a 
nation founded on creative free enterprise entrepreneurs canada
is a nation built on monopolies

things arent all that bad i remember vancouver
as having a broad variety of good local eateries
and toronto as having a variety of good local
strip joints  i never ate a doughnut in
canada so i cannot vouch for their quality i
could live in either of these cities quite happily
but carolyn doesnt like cold weather

personally i almost never eat at a franchise
restaurant usually you can find better fare or
cheaper fare and often both at a local
restaurant
