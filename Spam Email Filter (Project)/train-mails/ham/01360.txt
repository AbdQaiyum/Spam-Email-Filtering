 uh the reason is simple habeas runs something called the
 habeas infringers list and if you use their trademark without
 their permission youll end up on it  then when you send spam
 with the misappropriated header users of sa  supports
 this will tag your mail as spam rather than let it through
 this may be done independantly of your ip address so be
 prepared to constantly change domain names and move your
 servers as fast as you send spam

 also that little haiku is a copyrighted work so not only can
 habeas sue they must sue to protect their copyright and since
 its a trademark as well thats a doublewhammy habeas has
 some pretty highpowered legal people who will gladly go to
 town on violators

 the whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they
 need to put spammers out of business and not only block mail
 from them but allow through the things that really arent spam

 b

and if a spammer forges headers
