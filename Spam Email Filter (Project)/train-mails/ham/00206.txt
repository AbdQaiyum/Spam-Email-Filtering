hi

ive got an normal  cdrw ide drive that id like to be able to use with a
dell latitude cpx laptop that ive got does anyone know any way to enable this
for example through the use of a special cable for the modular bay where cdrom
or floppy drive is normally

there is also the possibility of using a docking station but dells docking
solution for the latitude series doesnt seem to allow for the use of an ide
drive only scsi unless someone knows of a nondell solution thats
compatible

anyone any ideas

thanks

darren
