there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale picketts
hammiepy and the original gbayespy  according to the readmetxt
gbayespy hasnt been kept up to date  is there anything in there
that isnt covered by hammiepy  about the only useful feature of
gbayespy that hammiepy doesnt yet copy is u which calculates
spamness for an entire mailbox  this feature can easily be copied
into hammiepy  gbayespy also has a large collection of tokenizers
but timtokenpy rules so im not sure how interesting that is now

therefore i propose to nuke gbayespy after adding a u feature

anyone against  i imagine that skip or barry might have a stake in
gbayespy tim seems to have moved all code hes working to other
modules
