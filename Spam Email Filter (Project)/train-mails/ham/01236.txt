hi

how about applying this to the default aptconf shipped with the
freshrpmsnet apt package  i found it a bit weird when the behaviour
changed between the old x and the new x versions so that when
doing a aptget upgrade it wouldnt tell me which packages were to
be upgraded just that it was about to upgrade something

 aptconf	  
 aptconf	  
   
   get 
   
      downloadonly false
     showupgraded true
