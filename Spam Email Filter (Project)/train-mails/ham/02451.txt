school classmates being interviewed on npr about her new film that she
wrote and directed based on her recent successful book   do i have a
film out no do i have a successful book no me i spent nine months
this year on the dole becky was off in hollywood

 those of us who are envious of your success as a writer and artist
might find this a bit hard to understand  

 once when forced to mix with a wifes associates french husband
who spent most of his time blowing his horn about how he had wined and
dined and hung out with the famous and wonderful i became
progressively more and more jethrolike until i was using phrases like
heehaw yall  you done talked to him  my counterpart never
noticed my evolutionary decline even as hair sprouted from my
knuckles my forehead contracted my eyebrows merged and i started
grunting  fortunately my wife intervened and i was prevented from
doing my moonwatcher imitation with the chicken bones left from
dinner regression is a wonderful curative
