  thanks a lot   the rpms seem to be fine they worked for me out of
  the box on vanilla valhalla wlatest errata
 
 except that i dont see an init script in the rpms a sample one
 designed for rh is supposed to be in utilsalsasound  could you take
 a look if it can be included

it doesnt need to as red hat linux already sets correct permissions on all
alsa audio devices for locally logged in users through the consoleperms
file and the modulesconf files takes care of loading the right modules on
demand also aumix and the scripts that come with red hat linux still work
for controlling the volume so its still saved and restored when the
computer is halted even using alsa

im glad you got your card working with these im now wondering if i wont
maybe buy an amplifier that supports dolby digial decoding my current one
only does pro logic since ive read that alsa supports the spdif
optical output of the sound chip of my shuttle
httpfreshrpmsnetshuttle

from what i can tell after only  days using it  alsa rocks especially
since having a full oss compatibility results that it breaks nothing at
all
