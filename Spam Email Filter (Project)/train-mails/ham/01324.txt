 ive got spamassassin installed and tested on macos x 
 although there are issues with spamd still  so in addition to
 looking for new and different uses for sa id like to hear
 from folks using it under macos x

 i just recently converted our sa setup to use amavisd into our postfix

amavisd or amavisdnew if the latter you dont need spamd running since
amavisdnew calls sa functions directly
