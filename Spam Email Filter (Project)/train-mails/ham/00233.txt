us soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment 
scientists at carnegie mellon university have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was roadtested by us army chaplains in croatia 

this project shows how a relatively simple speechtospeech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using todays tools
said the team from carnegie mellon university in a research paper published
recently 

the research was commissioned by the us army which is increasingly finding
itself in peacekeeping roles where communication is key 

speaking in tongues 

in the balkans the army is not just supposed to conquer somebody robert
frederking of carnegie mellon university told the bbc programme go digital 

 
translators could be essential for us soldiers
 
in a peacekeeping situation you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart 

you cant just shot one of them you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them he said 

the portable translator was developed with a year using commercially
available laptops 

the army did not want to fieldtest the device in a battlefield situation
so instead the translator was tested by us army chaplains in croatia 

the chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically dont have any translation support explained mr frederking 

slow system 

for the trials the chaplains used the translator to speak to croatians who
knew just a smattering of english 

the system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
croatian turns the speech into text the written words are then translated
into english and read out by a speech synthesizer 

it went reasonably well half the time said mr frederking though it was
slow in translating phrases 

the research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field 

but they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development 

the audio voice translation guide system project was a joint venture between
the us army the military manufacturer lockheed martin and carnegie mellon
university
