 made other than that i bet you could do nonroot the following can
be scripted
 easily
 

  unpack them somewhere
  for each of them go to the top directory of the unpacked tarball
and do
 configure then look in im going by memory topdirutils you
should see a spec
 file there do this for the  tarballs and you get  spec files
 

the above steps can all be performed automatically
if the spec files are updated to include the necessary
macros in the prep setup q and build stages
this would make the building of the rpm files less
error prone and more selfcontained and it would be
somewhat selfdocumenting
