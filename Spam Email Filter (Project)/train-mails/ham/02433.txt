driver who hit moose fights county over meat

acton  in her freezer at home lisa pierce has ground beef and roasts
frozen vegetables and french fries even a couple of popsicles what she
doesnt have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on
nov  the moose that was rightfully hers but instead went to a neighbor

the lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the york county sheriffs
department to get back what she says she is owed

i think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor said pierce im a
woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it the moose is
gone i know that now i want to be compensated for the meat

whether or not that happens is uncertain her experience though highlights
a law some mainers may not be aware of but should get to know during this
peak time of deerversuscar accidents as the animals in their mating
season come out of the woods

the law is simple a biggame carcass caught by a car  be it a moose deer
or bear  goes to the person who hits it as long as a law enforcement
officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident

it comes up quite often in maine say officials last year there were 
cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and  accidents
involving moose according to mark latti spokesman for the maine warden
service

in a state of what  million with only  licensed hunters i
dont know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a
moose said latti you do have the option of keeping it

which for some people can be valuable compensation for a damaged car
farmgrown deer meat can retail for  to  per pound in stores and a
butchered or dressed moose which cant be bought or sold anywhere in maine
can produce hundreds of pounds of food

latti said when it comes to moose the law has been abused since its
inception in  every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a
driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car that kind of hunting
makes no sense to latti

hitting a moose even at a slow speed is no laughing matter large adult
moose can weigh up to  pounds and can be more than  feet tall since
the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars their bodies
often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not
crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal

sometimes they are fatal in  latti said there were six mooserelated
fatalities after that when the number of moosehunting permits went from
 to  there were less maine had three mooserelated fatalities in
 one in  and two this year so far said stephen mccausland
spokesman for the maine public safety department

pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car
did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also
feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled

on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a
neighbors son to school in her  dodge dynasty she said she was going
along at about  mph on a welltraveled road when a moose came out of
nowhere

by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she
said 

pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the
children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose
but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal
with it so she said she wasnt able to follow up on the animal until later
that day

when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the
fullyracked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor

her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the  it
took him to carry it away money she didnt think she should spend by the
time she contacted the attorney generals office on nov  to complain
about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbors price had gone up
another  for the cost of butchering  pounds of meat

and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain
that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officers
fault that she didnt have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash
and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york
county

at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but
wanting money ouellette said

that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil
cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the
moose

but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to
other officials

its the officers discretion said latti and if the officer feels the
person cant immediately remove the animal hes got to think of public
safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her
children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask
is if she wants the moose

maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents
that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal
deer or moose becomes secondary

the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he
said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal cant
wait so well probably give it to the next person who stops by

this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the
ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her
boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal
herself

she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other
people especially other women do not have the same experience

what about people who dont know the law she said standing up for my
rights has just been a big headache
