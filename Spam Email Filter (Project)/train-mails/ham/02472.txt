  two demonstrators heading to saturdays
 antiwar
  march in san francisco were critically
 injured
  when their heads sticking through the roof
 of a
  former school bus hit the top of the
 broadway
  tunnel
 
 not quite so funny as they both subsequently
 died i think
 

  broadly i was trying to be both vulgar and
ironic in a big city as small as san francisco
there is as i believe i stated in the initial
post maybe one place in the whole that they
shoulda kept their heads inside they were told
to they didnt and they got what was coming to
them ill feel bad about getting a sick chuckle
out of it maybe when it happens to someone i know
personally til then haw haw haw like the
darwin awards get it
