 this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion but amavisd in all
 its incarnations and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject
 at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold often   

argh they do not do they   the fps must be just gigantic 

 if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 
 thered better be zero fps because all those filters would drop their
 thresholds to 

well my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits     any higher does us no good as it means an fp is
a lot harder to recover from using compensation rules

spams will hit higher than that  thats just the way the scoring works
but for our code to be effective and spread the range of scores
correctly we just have to optimise to hit  threshold
