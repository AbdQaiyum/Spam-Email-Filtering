 subject ilug what howtos for soho system


 hi all
 im trying to set up the following

  a linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
 ethernet card for lan connectivity
  other lan pcs with ethernet cards using the linux server for
 dnsdhcp etc

 basically i want to route any non lan traffic through the ppp

 ive got some of the way but like a similar post earlier about modem
 problems when i am connected to the internet with eht up the routing
 is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp eh must be the
 default route or something

 is there standard out of the box linux tools that will carry out
 portmapping on behalf of the lan pcs   im planning on non routable
 addresses xx for the lan routed outwards via the ppp
 interface

 can someone point me at the right howtos or routing documentation i need
 to follow 
 thanks
 dermot
