 whats an autoham

automatically marking something as ham after a given timeout regardless of how long 
that timeout is someone is going to forget to submit the message back as spam 

how many spamsashams can be accepted before the fn rate gets unacceptable


  how about adding an imap server with a spam and deletedham
  folder most email clients can handle imap users should be able to
  quickly move spam into the spam folder
 
 i personally dont think imap has a bright future but for people who
 do use it thats certainly a good approach
 
  instead of deleting messages or by reprogramming the delete
  function they can quickly move ham into the ham folder
 
 yes

i view imap as a stopgap measure until tighter integration with various email clients 
can be achieved

i still feel its better to require classification feedback from the recipient rather than 
make any assumptions after some period of time passes but this is an enduser issue 
and were still at the algorithm stage
