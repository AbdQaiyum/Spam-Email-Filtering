the structure of the internet has never
been about where the ditches and ruts
are dug although the world needs
ditch diggers too

its a simple inductive concept
you are you and see the world as such
you plus  degree of separation is a new you

all this stuff about scalefree internets viruses
sex and money is silly  scalefree statistically
indistinguishable models really means internetscale
as rediscovered by social networks people

 research has shown that the network of human sexual partners 
  seems to be scalefree too

i tend to prefer the harvard business review
to the economist as they tend to spend less
time writing about whos sleeping with whom and
come up with real statistical models

lies damn lies and statistics
