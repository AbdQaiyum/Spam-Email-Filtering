 the others are on mailing list only status for now a few of the
 groups i was in that are run by others are harder to deal with since
 many folks just dont want to have to deal with the inconvienence of a
 understanding

ive terminated a number of my own mailing lists at yahoogroups many
months ago because of similiar sentiments ive tried lobbying other
people to move but with about zero success

ive got currently only one own mailing list there which im going to
move as soon as it is technically possible which is my isps problem
basically after that i intend to kick yahoogroups for good
