 if you didnt add it when compile would be one way  another would be to
 grep your sendmailcf for the word milter

i dont know if theres a sendmailish way its not in the d output
but this should work

 strings which sendmail  grep i milter

if you get a long list of functionmessage looking phrases milter
is builtin  if you get something like

warning filter usage x requires milter support dmilter
milter warning option s requires milter support dmilter
id miltercv    zarzycki exp 

then its not builtin
