  hiall
  
  does anyone know how to list the biggest file in my
  root directoryor the second biggest etc
  
  because i want to find out what is the reason cause my
  root all most full
 
  find dir name    xargs du s  sort n
 
 smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end so if
 you want to get the  largest files pipe through tail

adding r to the sort options and piping through head instead
might be a better idea tail needs to read teh whole buffer head
only reads the first n lines

cheers
