i recently brought up a new system  suse  and i am running
spamassassin and procmail which work fine

i tried bringing up razor  but i am not able to get the sdk to
install and razor reports missing modules they appear to be there i
followed the installation directions there appears to be an endless list
of errors any ideas on what to do or where to start
