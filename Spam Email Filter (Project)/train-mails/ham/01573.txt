 this is my first time running razor heard a lot of good things about it so
 i thought id give it a shot  i also run spamassassin so id like to
 integrate the two
 
 im not sure if this problem is with spamassassin or razor so i though id
 shoot the message here first
 
 with a freshly installed spamassassin  and razor  im seeing these
 messages spit out from spamd
 
 razor check skipped no such file or directory cant call method log on
 unblessed reference at usrlibperlsiteperlrazorclientagentpm
 line  stdin line 
 
 any ideas  razor seems to run correctly over the command line
 
 thanks
 dave
