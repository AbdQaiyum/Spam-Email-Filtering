woah  did you tweak some flags yourself like default rpm flags  what 
dist are you running  i dont think theres an athalonredhatlinux 
machine as standard  it should be some permutation of athlon and linux 
and without redhat but i cant tell for sure   any idea where your 
system might be setting this flag 


  rpm build errors
     user jkeating does not exist  using root
     group jkeating does not exist  using root
     user jkeating does not exist  using root
     group jkeating does not exist  using root
     bad exit status from homedalerpmbuildtmprpmtmp prep

looks like the files are owned by the wrong user ie the original spec
