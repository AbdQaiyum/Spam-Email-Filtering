 potential employers to mock and i dont want to pay for it there are still
 a couple dozen places to do this do any of you have preferences

getting your own domain neednt be expensive looks more professional and
youre not going to suddenly lose your site with little or no notice yes
im still smarting from bastard geocities i registered mine through
httpwwweasyspacecom  works out about a pound a week for registration
and mb hosting its a valuable service theres no reason not to expect
to pay
