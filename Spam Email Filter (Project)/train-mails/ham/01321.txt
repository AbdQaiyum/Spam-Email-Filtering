there is a whitelist rbl now  ironports bonded sender is 
basically a whitelist rbl where you post a bond to get on the 
list and then lose the bond if you end up spamming from that ip 
address or something like that  httpwwwbondedsenderorg

  dnsbl only certifies an ip address not who is using it as it is
 currently used dnsbl allows you to look up if some ip address 
 has been
 blacklisted by someone what i havent seen is a service that 
 provides a
 dns based whitelist

 theres a practical reason for that  any dns list white or 
 black works
 only for a limited number of ips the set of unlisted ips is 
 much larger
 than the set in the dns list  if you have to make a binary decision to
 accept or reject youll be wrong less often if you reject the 
 blacklist
 and accept everything else rather than accept the whitelist and reject
 everything else

 a whitelist is only helpful when a you only want mail from a limited
 number of known sources or b you can use a secondary system 
 like sa to
 decide what to do with the vast unlisted masses  most mtas still make
 only the binary decision because the secondary computation is 
 expensive

 with sas cooperation though it might be worth a try  even better if
 one could get commercial antispam outfits to agree to factor it in
