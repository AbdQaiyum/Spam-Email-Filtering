 hi matt and thanks for your quick reply
 
 matt dont run sa on mails this large
 
 that would be fine if i only understood how i should do that i cant
 find anything in the sa documention that mentions some kind of upper
 limit for the size of a message what should i put in my userprefs
 file
 
 i run sa from procmail btw but i cant imagine that procmail would be
 able to check the size of a message before handing it over to sa

thats exactly what it can do
