     any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for
     inclusion w the spambayes project

    tp i gave it all the thought it deserved wink  it would be
    tp wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test
    tp data and im all in favor of that  otoh my data subtree
    tp currently has more than  files slobbering over 
    tp million bytes  even if i had a place to put that much stuff
    tp im not sure my isp would let me email it in one msg wink

check it into the spambayes project  sfs disks are cheap wink
