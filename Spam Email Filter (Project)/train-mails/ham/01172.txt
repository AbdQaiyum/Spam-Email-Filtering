help
i had gpg working
i updated from version gnupg to gnupg
this moved gpg from usrbin to usrlocalbin and i changed the path
in the exmh executable

with that fix exmh knows i have gpg and puts the line

	check the signature with gnupg

in messages with gnupg signatures  but punching the line always
gives

        signature made thu aug    mdt using dsa key id bddfa
        cant check signature public key not found

so something else is missing
can somebody tell me what it is ive tried grepping on everything
that i can think of with no luck at all
