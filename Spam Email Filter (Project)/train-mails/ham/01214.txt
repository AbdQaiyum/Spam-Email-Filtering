as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc
and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll
probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system 


i think this is probably the best way because i think maybe with upgrading you
do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
because rh would rather take it easy and not update that config file you get a
rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file so they get less calls to support that way

anyway i have tons of media files in home probably  to  gigs at least my
laptops cdrom takes mb at a time obviously and compressing media files is
dumb because they are already compressed dumb question how to backup huge data
network backup to another box i do not have a box with a tape drive but maybe box
with a large hd with much free space could take the backup oops i do not have a
space computer with a large hd with much free space

these media files are backed up  on the cds they came from yes i learned that
used cds make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf i do not want to rerip all
this crap again


thats angle as in geometry
