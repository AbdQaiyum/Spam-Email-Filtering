anil dash xml version  why isnt there a way to syndicate my 
words without butchering the way they look several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this jason 
levine has more links to those involved i spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it and she claims it wasnt a protest as such more of an inside 
joke point taken the entire point of an aggregator and syndication in 
general is to make everyones words look the same counterpoint the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in rss feeds nobodys 
forcing you to publish full posts this would probably be a good place to 
insert a zen quote about attachment but my mind is too fuzzy to find it 

timothy appnel more ffkar rdf and foaf ffkar is the format 
formerly known as rss sam has already implemented it 

nicholas avenell esf are you also fed up with the continuing war 
between rss  and  and  and whatever else they invent today me too 
so today i invented the epistula syndication format esf it isnt xml it 
isnt rdf its just data sam would love it then but movable type 
doesnt support outputting dates in unix timestamp format which could be an 
impediment to mainstream acceptance 

shelley powers consumer rights and rss im not buying into rss 
x im not buying into rss  im not buying into rss  i changed my 
rss  and rss  templates to read the following 

    rss not supported here 

    this weblog does not support rss x rss  or rss  if you wish to 
    view entries may i suggest that you visit the weblog and save your fast 
    skimming for the new york times and wall street journal 

im sure this is some sort of dmca violation or something but here goes
