   ham that you dont say is spam within  hours

i have folks who leave their email programs running  hours a day constantly polling 
for mail if they go away for a long weekend lots of friday night spam will become 
ham on sunday night  friday night seems to be the most popular time


  your idea here

ultimately id like to see tight integration into the most popular email clients as a 
stopgap to the autoham 

how about adding an imap server with a spam and deletedham folder most email 
clients can handle imap users should be able to quickly move spam into the spam 
folder 

instead of deleting messages or by reprogramming the delete function they can 
quickly move ham into the ham folder

in either case the message would be processed and then destroyed
