ben hammersley posts a parable about design specifications showing the link 
between roman chariots and the space shuttle it has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me but its a good read nevertheless 

    the us standard railroad gauge distance between the rails is  feet 
     inches that is an exceedingly odd number why was that gauge used 
    because thats the way they built them in england and the us railroads 
    were built by english expatriates 

    why did the english build them that way because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the prerailroad tramways and thats 
    the gauge they used 

    why did they use that gauge because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons which used 
    that wheel spacing 

    so why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing well if they tried 
    to use any other spacing the wagon wheels would break on some of the old 
    long distance roads in england because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts 

snopes says its false but from their notes it appears that its actually 
largely true albeit subject to interpretation link discuss
