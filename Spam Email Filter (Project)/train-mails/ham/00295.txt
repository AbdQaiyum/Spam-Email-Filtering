an investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages

trading standards officers working for greenwich council were alerted to 
the situation after a bryan punch bag purchased in argos in charlton road 
charlton was found to be full of bandages

also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in fife stating how she felt quite disgusted about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested

the unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag at argos in lewisham high 
street but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads

so far officers have purchased two of the punch bags only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet

cabinet member for public services councillor angela cornforth said this 
is one of the strangest stories i have every heard

our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents
