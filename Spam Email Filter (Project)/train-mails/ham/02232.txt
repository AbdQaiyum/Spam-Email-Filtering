heres a brief interview with me  

    interviewer if the boing boing zine and blog were tv characters whod 
    they be and howd they get on 

    mark the zine would be jethro bodine of the beverly hillbillies  
    curious neophilic xenophilic gleeful and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth the blog would be sherman from 
    peabodys improbable history  a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty truth and the outre i think jethro boing boing and sherman boing 
    boing would be great pals jethro would invite shermans dog mr peabody 
    to go raccoon hunting with him and sherman would send jethro  years into 
    the future to hang out at the playboy mansion
