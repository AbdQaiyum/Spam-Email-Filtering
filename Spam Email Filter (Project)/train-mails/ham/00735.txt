the idea came at the end of a long frustrating brownbag session at a
publicpolicy think tank here

the challenge was to save the citys childcare programs staring into
his empty coffee cup the meeting coordinators mind landed on an
unlikely solution put a taxjust a benign dime a shoton
espresso

that led to a petition signed by more than  seattle residents
and next year voters will decide whether the tax becomes law one
that taps right into seattles legendary addiction to coffee this is
after all the town where starbucks was born and where the  pound
of beans became a staple there is one starbucks for every 
residents in seattle compared to one per  in new york seattle
also has two other major coffee chains tullys coffee and seattles
best coffee as well as countless cafes and espresso carts

a recent poll showed that  of seattle residents would vote for the
tax for people outside of seattle who dont understand the
consumption of espresso the tax proposal can be seen as crazy
said john burbank the think tanks executive director but it was
common sense

research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that
people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but
because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold a tax on
espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol

burbank estimates the tax could generate  million to  million a
year city council aides dispute his figures saying their research
shows the tax would bring in  million to  million a year

burbanks institute is funded by foundations and labor unions the
think tanks mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
lowincome people and it has long championed childcare issues

burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the childcare programs
made earlier this year by gov gary locke he also says it would
provide more lowincome families with subsidies for child care
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries

at bauhaus books  coffee the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a halfday activity not just a drink

espresso lovers like chris altman who at a dime a day would spend an
extra  a year said the investment is worth it im ok with
it said the yearold stirring his iced latte the moneys got
to come from somewhere

hope revuelto  was cooling her regular coffee  because she
brought her own mug and reading zen and the art of pottery she
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers they want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying  cents to help the needy

some say the tax isnt the issue they just resent being singled out

david marsh  a costume manager drinks up to three espressos a
day which means hed be shelling out an extra  a year i for
one dont have kids but i drink espresso he said as he sewed a
leather collar onto a chainmail tunic i dont mind paying but i
think everyone should pay

coffeehouses are steamed about it and theyve organized as
joltjoined to oppose the latte tax among the members are seattles
chamber of commerce and the citys two largest coffee franchises
starbucks and tullys

the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
contains espresso a task that could be an administrative nightmare
for smaller cafes especially during the frantic morning rush if
espresso counts come under suspicion coffeehouse owners could face a
city audit

university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesnt add up 

the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable and this is
neither he said on the efficiency side its surely going to lead
to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
avoid the tax for example starbucks could claim that they are using
finely ground coffee instead of coffee run though an espresso maker
and that consequently they are exempt from the tax would they be
right i dont know but finding out will surely take lots of legal
fees that could have gone to child care

of course from a publicrelations perspective this is an ingenious
idea and i mean that in a cynical way theyve pitted espresso
drinkers against childcare supporters and whos going to side with
the espresso drinkers

in fact the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
twostep where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
stance of political correctness in a liberal city like seattle
corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
activism and throughout the debate over the initiative jolt members
prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care

starbucks will continue to support earlylearning and
childhooddevelopment programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually the company said however starbucks does not
understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages or any other single
consumer product

the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
voters next year the initiatives authors say it is directed at
vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee
the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso including decaf drip coffee would be exempt

burbank says the tax would reach only a preselected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so hes been
pitching it as a modernday robin hood tax where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend  to  on an espresso

its the kind of political marketing that fran beulah  finds
funny i drink espresso she said laughing and i am not rich
