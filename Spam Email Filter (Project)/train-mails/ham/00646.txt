that means you cant say anything may not be forked or printed or 
whatever you have the choice to ignore it


thats not what the first amendment says at all it says that congress cannot 
say what cant be forked fork can establish any rules it wants similarly 
the new york times gets to choose what news it thinks is fit to print if 
the times chose not to print anything about say rosie odonnell it would 
be exercising its first amendment rights just as much as it would be if it 
chose to print something rosie odonnell doesnt like the necessary 
corollary of the freedom to saypublish what one wants is the freedom to 
refuse to publish or say what one doesnt like the alternative is a 
statecontrolled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
news

the question of what is or is not forked is except for libel or other 
specific exceptions not a matter of law but a matter of what the 
publisher if any decides or the community if any negotiates or does 
as a matter of custom

for my part id rather people didnt use fork as a place in which to dump an 
expression of their political beliefs
