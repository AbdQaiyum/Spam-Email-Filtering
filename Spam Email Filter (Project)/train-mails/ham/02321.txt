we in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
addictive we think that quality in a game is a good thing people like it 
they keep coming back to it and they want to play it more and more i agree 
that its a good thing if a game has that quality then its probably a darn 
good game but using the word addiction to describe that quality does us no 
favors with the general public
