blake blogs about how mpt wants mozilla to look just like msie i have to 
admit the evidence is pretty compelling i recall someone asking me do you 
really agree with mpts top  list hes quoted you at the top of the list

do i agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems of 
course not no two people will have the same top ten problems also keep in 
mind that mpt and i can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed thats something

to cover the list specifically


 navigator chrome structure  while i dont necessarily agree with mpts 
proposed default configuration i do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem

 speed  cant argue with this except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless ui and features from the chrome helps substantially reduce bloat gain 
speed

 text editing  if you use chimera on the mac youll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application its buggy 
slow misbehaves and doesnt edit the way youd expect this is imo chimeras 
top usability problem

 message display  yes no argument here

 search  yeah its a mess dont know if it would be in my top ten but its 
a mess

 menu structure  this gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated the menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications a clean separation naturally simplifies the menus eg 
you can eliminate the new submenu easily

 migration  a problem but imo not one of the top ten facing mozilla

 context menus  mpt complains about twoclick context menus and yet the os 
default on win overwhelmingly is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up 
if you dont like it complain about win but dont cite this as a mozilla 
usability problem when were following the conventions of the operating system 
we simply listen for the wmcontextmenu message that message fires when win 
wants to fire it

 validation  err no not a usability problem to the average bear this is 
completely irrelevant

 preferences  imo this should be much higher on the list preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess again separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the gui mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable
