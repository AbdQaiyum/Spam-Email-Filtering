 weve not only reduced the fp and fn rates in my test runs weve also
 made the score distributions substantially sharper  this is bad news for
 greg because the nonexistent middle ground is becoming even less
 existent wink

well ive finally got around to pulling down the sf code starting
with it and absolutely zero local modifications i see the following

ham distribution for all runs
   items
    
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
      
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
      
     

spam distribution for all runs
   items
      
       
       
       
       
       
      
      
      
       
       
      
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
      
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
      
       
       
      
      
      
      
      
   


my next current task is to complete the corpus ive got  its currently
got   ham  spam and about  currently unsorted im tossing 
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort   previously
ive used various forms of grep for keywords and a little gui thing to 
pop a message up and let me say spamham but thats just getting too too
tedious

i cant make it available en masse but i will look at finding some of
the more interesting uglies one thing ive seen consider this 
anecdotal for now is that the skip tokens end up in a lot of the 
fps
