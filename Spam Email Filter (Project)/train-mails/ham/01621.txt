there is a software package that is used or was up through wk 
on microsloth for this purpose ghost or some such one essentially 
takes a picture of the machines proper config and then upon 
schedule or demand replaces the machines current config with the 
proper picture it essentially overwrites the entire disk drive 
especially good for student access machines at libraries etc

and it is pretty common practice in some environments with public 
workstations to just wipe and reinstall windows machines on a weekly 
or even daily basis its easier than trying to maintain windows
