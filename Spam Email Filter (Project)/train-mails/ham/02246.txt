jeffrey zeldman party like its  microsoft has redesigned 
its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mids  when a wc member company that helped create xhtml and css 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site you have to 
wonder who didnt get the memo 

the new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests the home 
page contains  instances of images without alt text this is the same basic 
failing for which the sydney organizing committee for the olympic games was 
successfully sued in  

here is what microsoftcom looks like in a textonly browser to better 
understand the experience take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time while nothing is technically locked out all the links are 
regular links nothing requires javascript to function properly all the 
unaltenhanced images which are mostly spacer images and imagesasbullets 
add so much clutter to the page that its very difficult to navigate 

meanwhile i dont want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader want to find the search box thats pttrans dot gif pttrans 
dot gif search for pttrans dot gif pttrans dot gif form edit box pttrans dot 
gif submit button go pttrans dot gif link advanced search pttrans dot gif 
 and i hope you werent looking for microsofts accessibility home 
page its the th link on the page out of
