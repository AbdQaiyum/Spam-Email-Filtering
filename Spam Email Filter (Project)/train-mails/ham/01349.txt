something to watch out for is to use nomime   in the mailaudit
ctor the ma folks changed the api there

what has mime to do with it  i read in perldoc ma that your suggestion 
is less expensive but how does that help sa
 
 
 ma for some reason changes its base class depending on whether the
 incoming message is mime or not  therefore the mailinternet methods
 suddenly become unavailable for mime messages
 
 you do not want to know what i thought of that when i found it 

as a new user of sa i guess im having trouble connecting the dots  if 
i understand you  if i dont use the nomime   option and i recieve 
mime mail the mailinternet modules become unavailable

unavailable for which  ma  sa  what do these methods do  does this 
mean my incoming mime mail wont be checked by sa unless i specify 
nomime  

thanks
phil
