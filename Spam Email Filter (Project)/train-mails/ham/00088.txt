i need to setup a vpn between a few sites from what ive read the the
choices come down on the linux side to ipsec using freeswan or cipe
it seems that freeswan is better being an implementation of ipsec which
is a standard however cipe does the job as well for linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup 

the problem is that its not a pure linux situation  a couple of the sites
run osx im pretty sure that ill be able to find an implementation of
ipsec for osx but i think cipe is linux only

so the question is for those of you have have implemented both  is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between cipe and freeswan 
if cipe is going to be much easier than dealing with freeswan and whatever
on the osx sites then ill simply get a linux box for each of the remote
sites  with the low price of hardware it doesnt take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic
