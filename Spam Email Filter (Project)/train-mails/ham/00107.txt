 for the francophones among you this article is a summary of the
 reasons why most free software licences and the gpl in
 particular are not valid in france

 google translation hard to read most of the time but good
 enough to pick up the gist

 httpmakeashorterlinkcomub

 in brief in an international contract when mentioning copyright  you
 must mention under which jurisdictions laws the copyright
 is applied french law requires the licence to be available in
 french the gpl isnt and french law requires that for a
 contract to be valid it must not breach existing law also under
 french law the copyright holder automatically retains the right
 to change the licence which means that french law is in conflict
 with the gpl which requires authorisation from all authors
 before a licence change is allowed

 also theres some stuff about french consumer law forbidding sale
 without guarantee of anything so software delivered asis
 breaches consumer law in france but i didnt really follow that

my french is a bit iffy these days but if this is true does it not also
nullify microsoft adobe and winzip licences amongst most others these all
claim no liability no guarantees m say delivered with all faults so
at least they are honest
