has anyone though of the idea of live updates of rules after release the 
idea being that the user can run a cron job once a week or so and get the 
new default rule set this would allow us to react faster to
 
 
 i suggested this a few months ago  i dont remember the details of what
 came out of it except that it would only be useful for noneval rules
 since those require code changes
