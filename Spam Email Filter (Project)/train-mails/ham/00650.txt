q and a section

shiver my timbers

from tad spencer please could you tell me where the phrase shiver 
my timbers originated

this is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors usage

its an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver or shake so implying a 
calamity has occurred it is first recorded as being used by captain 
frederick marryat in jacob faithful in  i wont thrash you tom 
shiver my timbers if i do

it has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later robert louis stevenson found it to be just the kind of oldsalt 
saying that fitted the character of long john silver in treasure 
island cross me and youll go where many a good mans gone before 
you  some to the yardarm shiver my timbers and some by the board 
and all to feed the fishes since then its mainly been the preserve 
of secondrate seafaring yarns
