   are you using the same version of gcc to compile the plugin as its c
   dependencies
  
  yes i am  everything is built inside a chroot  i think it isnt
  linking to a lib somewhere im just not sure what lib it should
  preloading here  anyway to find out which one it is 
 
 looks like a problem with the avifile youve rebuilt ive been unable to
 recompile successfully the latest version on  

hm it is built inside the same chroot  aviplay works well it would if i 
had xv i get x errors   but it doesnt complain about linker 
problems  so i suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok

sigh avifile is one of the worst packages out there in all aspects  
naming of tarballs not ever releasing an actual package versioning of 
libraries api stability
