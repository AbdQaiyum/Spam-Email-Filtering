your actual serial number is   from a dig ive just done

try resetting the zone number to   some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that so they clearly regard  as 
being less than 

that should enable them to pick up the new zonefile

hi all
the serial number in our hosts files on our dns server has gone
corrupt eg  should be 
its okay to set this back to todays date but i understand that our
secondary and terninary dns servers will only update from the master
hosts file if the master host serial number is greater than the current
serial number in the hosts file
is there any way i can reset this on the secondary and terninary dns
servers
