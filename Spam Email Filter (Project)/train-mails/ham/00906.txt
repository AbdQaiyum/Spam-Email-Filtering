im truly stuck on this though  i dont know whether to frame the
check burn it or cash it in

i framed my  check from mpcom someone bought the cd i have up there
some years back and it is my real and actual proof in saying i am a paid
musician of course i never cashed the check so techinaly i never did get
paidbut thats another matter alltogther
