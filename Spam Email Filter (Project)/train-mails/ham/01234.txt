 anyone know why red hat insist on sticking with python 

ehhh  ianahnbarhe  rhl  is fully python with a back
compatability v  shim set  this has been working and freely
available in their raw hide for  months for early adopters
and backporters

red hat maintains binary compatability across major releases  
its server management tools are heavily python and becoming 
more so

to have added midstream the python series in the rhl x
series would have been quite disruptive to an existing 
installed base
