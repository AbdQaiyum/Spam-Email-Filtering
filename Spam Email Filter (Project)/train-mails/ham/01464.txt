jm now all we need to do is get all the spamassassin users out there to
jm upgrade

considering that the rules need to adapt to the changing look and feel
of spam vs nonspam does it make sense to have sa automatically
issue a notice when it is say  months old recommending that the
useroperator check for updated rules

sort of like a nagware feature but in selfdefense for the user not
the vendor

better yet would be a builtin server check on a periodic basis even
daily looking for the existence of an update and if found prompt the
system admin to upgrade the server  with the ever changing face of spam
this would probably be a big benefit to sa users and help keep everyone up
to date  we have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
wwwrosecitysoftwarecom strictly because of joeaverageuser concerns
about spyware and phoning home but in cases where the app needs to
access the internet anyhow we have done it with great success and minimal
concern by our users
