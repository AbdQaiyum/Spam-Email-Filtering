 oh yeah i was following this thread in the sylpheedclaws list  very
 interesting stuff  i might have to stick w  until aspell gets
 updated in red hat

then this may be  months or more since my guess after  beta releases is
that the freeze on package versions for inclusion in the next stable
release n has already happened thus youll have to wait at least for
red hat linux n 

this is why if it doesnt break anything ill maybe release recent
aspell packages but to be sure ill need to do some testing
