 
 i downloaded a driver from the nvidia website and installed it using rpm
 then i ran sax as was recommended in some postings i found on the net
but
 it still doesnt feature my video card in the available list what next


hmmm

peter

open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
nvdriver

if it isnt loaded then load it
insmod nvdrivero
oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise

once the kernel module is loaded

vim etcxxfconfig

in the section marked
driver i have neomagic
you need to have
driver nvidia

here is part of my xfconfig

also note that using the card you are using you should be able to safely
use the fbbpp  option 

section module
 load  extmod
 load  xie
 load  pex
 load  glx
 subsection dri    you dont need to load this peter
  option     mode 
 endsubsection
 load  dbe
 load  record
 load  xtrap
 load  speedo
 load  type
endsection
