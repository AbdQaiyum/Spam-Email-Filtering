i know its not the popular choice for a lot of people but id
suggest um church  like woody allen said  of life is
showing up right


almost anyone can find a church where the sermons dont make you bust
out laughing and youre set i for instance am a unitarian which
as someone once observed is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course obuujokes mid s bumpersticker
honk if youre not sure lenny bruce did you hear about how the
klan burned a question mark on the unitarians lawn unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself unitarians pray to whom it may concern etc

but seriously folks my teenageadopted denomination im um
lapsed on several fronts a dutchreformedturnedatheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern baptist of some stripe
or another and frankly limousine liberal secularhumanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenitalrepublican smalll libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be except for the secularhumanist
bit and i still go pretty regularly though not as much as i
used to heck the older i get the less of the divine i believe in
im asymptotically approaching my fathers atheism these days and i
show up at least once a month nice folks though when i can keep a
civil tongue in my head  smart too when i cant and end up arguing
with them 


anyway if i can end up hitched anyone can talk about orthogonal
i met my practicallysocialist stateeducationbureaucrat wife one
year after i started moved in with her  weeks later  married
her  years after that and i wasnt even trying meet women i was
just looking to make friends as i was new in town


the trick to the church thing is whatever denominationcongregation
you end up in expect to end up with a mate not a date i mean some
guys manage to stay single but most like me dont you can
practically see the lasersights light up when you walk into a
room

thats because of course most churches are run by women most
regular attendants are women hell  of all new ministers in
protestant denominations at least are women no matter your age
looks intelligence whatever youll end up surrounded by women
youll be outnumbered even several to one  some of whom are at
least better looking than you are  the only place where there
are more women running things is in grassroots republican politics
  but i wont go there i promise


if i may make a presumption here since you brought it up i figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinents
religions and the ubiquity of indians in various stages of
assimilation in sonocal you can find some place to hang out near
you rohit you probably dont even have to go um native like i
did  backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming horrors a unitarian

cheers
