hi i was just wondering if anyone experiening difficulty with eircom
mail
severi was trying to send mail from mozilla mail but it keeps coming
up
with this error
sorrythat domain isnt in my list of allows rcpthosts
please check the message recipients and try again

what is this all about
i am using maileircomnet as my smtp and my pop i can recieve mail
but
i cannot send mail is there any other open relay that i  can use

i think youll find its at eircons end i occasionally have problems
sending to a server i use whose admin said its a known bug for which
he had to apply a patch youll probably want to tell eircons admins
that they need to patch the server and to redo it if they think its
already done

sorry for the lame answer but its been so long ive forgotten the
details

have fun
jim
