loo rolls of honour and the invisible man

paper clips a roundup of the weekly press

by steven mccaffery

the powersthatbe tell us that crime does not pay and they found an 
ally in the ulster herald this week which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career the 
omaghbased papers as the man says column brings a story which 
originated in the middle east

a gent recently attempted to rob a bank in tehran the columnist reports

he was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers hands

it is then explained he had paid  to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible

in the lurgan mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery

a lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal  worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional the paper reports

the thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop

moving statues of religious icons out of the way the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagents cigarette stand removing the 
contents

the owner of the paper chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying on monday morning when my 
wife was opening everything looked normal

but when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door

the paper reports that the shop was the target of another well 
organised crime  weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe

the shops owner says the closer it gets to christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this

the issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
down democrat

writing in the downpatrickbased newspaper john coulter calls on the 
authorities to birch the vandals plaguing the local community

he is shocked at reports of the wanton destruction by vandals and 
issues a call for action

the time has come to fight fire with fire he writes before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using socalled kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found guilty of antisocial behaviour

as an alternative to such reckless violence he recommends 
controlled violence

it was a sorry day that the manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the isle of man

getting his defence in early he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan

in many islamic countries public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day

you might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the united kingdom or ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late s

however people seem to forget that islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the british mainland and its only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes christianity
