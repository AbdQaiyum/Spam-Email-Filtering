 as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas
 or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc
 and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll
 probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system 
 
 i think this is probably the best way because i think maybe with upgrading you
 do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
 because rh would rather take it easy and not update that config file you get a
 rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file so they get less calls to support that way

if you dislike red hat why use it  this was a really bad argument 
against using red hat that makes no sense at all  i for one am glad that 
they 
a dont overwrite your config files on a whim be glad they dont do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap
b tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed

red hat is not taking it easy on this its putting control in the hands 
of you the maintainer of the machine  dont be lazy

 anyway i have tons of media files in home probably  to  gigs at least my
 laptops cdrom takes mb at a time obviously and compressing media files is
 dumb because they are already compressed dumb question how to backup huge data
 network backup to another box i do not have a box with a tape drive but maybe box
 with a large hd with much free space could take the backup oops i do not have a
 space computer with a large hd with much free space

you dont need to backup home if you are careful enough  you did put 
home on a separate partition no  just install rh and tell it to use 
the same partition as home and tell it to not format it but keep the 
data as is

if you didnt put home on a separate partition then you really do need 
to make backups  use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount or if thats not possible rsync over 
ssh  its the best way to make backups

 these media files are backed up  on the cds they came from 

its the other way around  your media files are backups of the cds they 
came from 

good luck
