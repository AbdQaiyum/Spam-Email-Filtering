when i receive a message that has a line starting with from  its
broken into two messages  i get my mail from varspoolmail  the
program that incorporates mail thinks that the from  line starts a new
message

my sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to 
escape lines begining with from   exmh  doesnt do this  should 
it  it appears that my mh is mh   does nmh fix this
