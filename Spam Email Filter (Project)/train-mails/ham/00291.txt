      ok its now time to work out the pgp securing of apt repository
      traffic ive never gotten anything but sitenamewhatever will not
      be authenticated until running redhat  when i get something
      about having no key for various files

i dont think gpg signing my repositories will help anything as it will
just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md signatures of
all pgklists and srclists basically youll then just be sure that its me
who generated the files and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when red hat updates show up

in red hat linux  though the warnings about no key appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm for example 
rpm import usrsharedocaptcncrpmgpgkey
this will import my key which is used to sign all freshrpmsnet packages

hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install only packages who
verify against an imported gpg key this for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work
