 the total collections are  messages  i trained with 
 messages

while thats not a lot of training data i picked random subsets of my
corpora and got much better behavior this is ratespy output fp rate per
run in left column fn rate in right

total false pos  
total false neg  

another full run with another randomly chosen but disjoint  of each in
each set was much the same  the score distribution is also quite sharp

its hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam but i suspect
better spam wink   of the  most powerful discriminators here were
htmlrelated spam indicators the top  overall were

        font  
        contenttypetextplain  
        body  
        html  
        click  
        html  
        wrote  
        skip   
        python  
        contenttypetexthtml  

the html tags come from nonmultipartalternative html messages from which
html tags arent stripped and there are lots of these in my spam sets

that doesnt account for it though  if i strip html tags out of those too
the rates are only a little worse

otal false pos  
otal false neg  

the thstrongest discriminator still finds another html clue though

heh  i forgot all about nbsp
