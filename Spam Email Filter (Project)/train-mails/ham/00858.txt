subject re optical analog computing

  the first computer to crack enigma was optical

 computing with interference patterns etc makes perfect sense but enigma
 was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially enigma
 machines and bruteforcing

look for zygalski sheets

by koerners narrative it wound up
being a hybrid affair bletchley had
mock enigmas which cycled through the
enigmas k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour but the germans
started using a plugboard which then
had x possibilities  the
poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings and so

 when we have collected several such cards corresponding to different
 initial signals  we place them in a pile so that the squares
 corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a
 light beneath the pile  only those squares which let the light
 through will correspond to possible daily settings

so the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of optical computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes
until

 on  may the germans invaded france and on the same day in
 accordance with the best cryptographic principles they changed their
 enigma procedures in such a way that the  zygalski sheets each
 with their carefully drilled  or so holes became just so much
 waste cardboard

  the first syntheticapertureradar processor was optical

this is also easy to believe given dr
elachis description of the  shuttle
imaging radar

 the received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved
 after landing  the film  is then processed in an optical correlator
 to generate the final image

which makes sense as one wishes to shift
each component of the return in proportion
to its frequency for which one presumably
needs a glorified prism

 alternatively the  signal can be digitized and then recorded on
 board or transmitted to the ground via a digital data link  this was
 the case with the  sensor flown in 



 koerner the pleasures of counting
in which various aspects of the enigma
decoding cover four chapters of which
i quote from two sections of one
 beautiful polish females and
 passing the torch
 churchills romantic soul loved the excitement and secrecy surrounding
 bletchley  he relished the way that
  the old procedures like the setting up of agents the suborning
  of informants the sending of messages written in invisible ink
  the masquerading the dressingup the secret transmitters and the
  examining of the contents of wastepaper baskets all turned out
  to be largely cover for this other source as one might keep some
  oldestablished business in rare books going in order to be able
  under cover of it to do a thriving trade in pornography and erotica
 
 looking at the disparate unkempt and definitely unmilitary crew
 formed by his top codebreakers he is said to have added to his head
 of intelligence i know i told you to leave no stone unturned to find
 the necessary staff but i did not mean you to take me so literally
