in addition one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in
 in san fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate  to k

this is the only quote i could find relating to promiscuity in
homosexual men

i think people feel a certain invulnerability especially young
people like this disease doesnt affect me the publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say that isnt me im not promiscuous promiscuity especially was a piece where people could easily say well im not promiscuous is more than i do if you have  partners a year you can think youre not promiscuous if you know somebody who has  so its all relative and it was easy to feel that that isnt me

you could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume  bfd
this kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty
religious bigots as you mentioned earlier

grr   bits damnit  now i must go brief

 i agree w ya tom  that kind of thinking is so idiotic  sure gays

el so how many of your hetero friends had  k lovers

bmn so eugen how many of your homo friends have had k lovers

bmn in fact thats a general question for fork proper

bmn do you know anyone outside of meybee wilt chamberlin and a few of the
bmn gangbang porn queens who have had even k lovers

bmn eegads if youre hypothesizing numbers like that eugen you at
bmn least owe it to fork to back that shit up

bmn otherwise were liable to assume rampant unfounded homophobia and that
bmn would just be a lose

bmn just a quick assumption here   im not a math geek or anything but
bmn assuming  lover every day that would be like at least one lover
bmn everyday for  years and some change   i dont know about you but
bmn very very few of us are that lucky or even close to that lucky
bmn and after awhile even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle
bmn something new into their weekends   you really are assumiing that the
bmn homosexual population is a that large in a given area the meccas
bmn might qualify but try finding that kind of homosexual population in
bmn say tulsa oklahoma or manchester nh tho manchester does have quite
bmn a few nifty gaybars but thats a different story  b that boredsex
bmn obsessedrecreationally free to pursue sex that often with that many
bmn partners or that theyd even want that many partners

bmn qualify yourself or at least lower your outrageous numbers

bmn bb
 are promiscuous and so are hets but i betcha gays are more
 aidsphobic than hets generally speaking

el the virus load issue is orthogonal to the fact bzzt switch on your
el brain you both i was mentioning that a subpopulation outside of the sex
el industry isused to be extremely promiscuous about two orders of
el magnitude higher than average
