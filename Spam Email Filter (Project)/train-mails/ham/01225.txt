 well i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
 against something that wasnt installed through rpm 

following that reasoning ive been installing all my custombuilt
kernels through rpm recently i find it annoying though that 
alsakernel and similar packages will only build for the currently 
running kernel

so ive attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
targetkernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you
still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed but at
least it doesnt have to be currently running its kinda hackish so
if someone has a better way to do this let me know
