 thanks for the great work mathias but i would like to point out that this
 list is fastly become the aptrpmlist instead of the rpmlist the
 discussion concerning apt is overwhelming maybe another list is in order
 for those having trouble with aptrpm aptrpmhotlinefreshrpmsnet  
 
 though i think aptrpm is a great tool i dont use it and would like to
 get back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques

hmmm know what on httplistsfreshrpmsnet the aptlist has been up
for a while now  there is almost no traffic though since i wanted to
keep that list for aptrpm on the server side mirrors building
repositories etc but hey it could be a good place for general aptrpm
questions
