 two new things today 
 
  ive had to install a red hat linux  server because of an old
 proprietary ivr software that doesnt work on newer releases  so
 ive recompiled both the latest apt and openssh packages for it and
 they are now available with a complete os updates  freshrpms apt
 repository at aptfreshrpmsnet for those who might be interested

oh neat

i have similiar thing in my hands though it might be migratable if i
had the time to try ive been using another x repository though
httpaptrpmtuxfamilyorgapt

anyone tried distupgrade from x to  theoretically it should drop
in some compats notably libc and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel and grub but i have long before put those to
vs  run just fine havent had a spare machine to try it on myself
though
