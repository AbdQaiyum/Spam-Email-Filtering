 i was thinking of just removing those particular rules but keeping the
 other entries in the range since theyre proving too noisy to be
 effective  but id be willing to keep those ones in all the same  what
 do you think  mattcraig thoughts

i think i could handle commenting out the lowest spamphrasexxyy
scores  if the ga could handle this sort of thing so theyd
automatically be zeroed id feel better since the ranges could change
next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked

i think we need to understand why dateinpast is so low before
we remove it  the two rules on either side perform quite well

 and here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should
 be recoverable

   frommissing
   gappytext
   invalidmsgid
   mimenullblock
   subjmissing

 well i dont like subjmissing i reckon theres a world of mails from
 cron jobs eg which hit it

okay drop subjmissing

 but yes the others for sure should be recoverable and im sure theres
 more

probably a few those seemed like the best prospects to me

 btw do you agree with the proposed methodology ie remove the rules and
 bugzilla each one

i only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with
quick wontfix closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery

if you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow should
be automatable with email at the very least it would help
