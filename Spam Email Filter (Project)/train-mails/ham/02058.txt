anyone have a copy of gill sans or bell centennial i can borrow i wonder if 
ill ever have  to spend on fonts update kevin marks who is 
stupendously incredible for far more things than i can list here points out 
that its included with os x i knew mac os x included a lot of grat fonts
 but i dont know how i overlooked this matthew carter id be happy to pay 
you the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling  worth of 
fonts
