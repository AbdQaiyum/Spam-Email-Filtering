  for toddlers pressing play must cause the music to start immediately
  within half a second for the toddler to get the causality and not press
 the
  button multiple times
 or some sound indicating that the music will start real soon now

a tonal countdown would be nice

  what would the ideal toddler cd player be like it would immediately start
  playing a cd after it was loaded
 itd be an mp player with solid state storage instant on

hmm seems like every cd player should include the
capability to rip encode and cache the last few cds 
inserted 

playback would then never need to face seek delays 
after the initial ripping the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which cd is inserted 
which might be doable faster than a seekandstartat
firsttrack operation

you could also take the cd out while it is playing

hmm if the cd is still in the cache maybe you dont
even have to insert it or choose it from a stepthrough
ui instead you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening kids would like that play this theyd
say facing the cd at the player and the player would
start immediately
