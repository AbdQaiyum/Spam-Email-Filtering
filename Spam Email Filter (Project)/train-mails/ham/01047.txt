 ok ill add this

cool 

 requiring a file that isnt part of an rpm is not possible no except
 maybe by stopping the build process if it isnt found but thats errr
 ugly
 and i really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources the
 easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too

yes it is  but then alsadriver requires alsakernel and i dont quite 
like nodeps

 this would be a tricky one since to use the with name feature of
 rpmbuild i think youd need to add individual handling of each and every
 card 

thats ok  i was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway not 
for some realworld need 

 thats what the alsadriver is there for create all the base files
 excluding the kernel drivers what i would suggest for dependency reasons
 it to install an alsakernel for the original kernel youve kept it
 right  and install alsa modules from source for custom kernels built
 from source

um  i keep  for emergency sitations like i forget to include 
keyboard support in kernel dumb me but alsakernel does not 
require kernel so thats ok
