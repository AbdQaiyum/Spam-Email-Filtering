 yeah thats exactly what i was doingi didnt realize i was
 incurring administrative pickle bloat this way  im specifically
 trying to make things faster and smaller so im storing individual
 wordinfo pickles into an anydbm dict keyed by token  the result
 is that its almost  times faster to score messages one per run
 our of procmail s vs s

this is very worthwhile

 however it does say all over the place that the goal of this
 project isnt to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so
 i guess ill hold off doing any further performance tuning until the
 goal starts to point more in that direction   seconds is probably
 fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc which is what
 i was after

maybe  i batch messages using fetchmail dont ask why and adding
 seconds per message for a batch of  not untypical feels like a
real wait to me
