this is due to insufficient write privileges to the razoragentlog 
file a quick workaround is to do a chmod gorx on that file of 
course its better to restrict the access as much as possible

in agentpm when the razorlogger object is created if it doesnt 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed then later 
in the code when the log object is used it fails with the unblessed 
error

hope this helps

this is my first time running razor heard a lot of good things about it so
i thought id give it a shot  i also run spamassassin so id like to
integrate the two

im not sure if this problem is with spamassassin or razor so i though id
shoot the message here first

with a freshly installed spamassassin  and razor  im seeing these
messages spit out from spamd

razor check skipped no such file or directory cant call method log on
unblessed reference at usrlibperlsiteperlrazorclientagentpm
line  stdin line 

any ideas  razor seems to run correctly over the command line

thanks
dave
