update on this for anyone thats interested and because i like closed 
threads nothing worse than an infinite while loop is there

i ended up formatting a floppy on my flatmates unnetworked p running 
fat win and mcopied the contents of the bootdisk across now i have a 
fat win install running alongside slackware and can play metal gear 
solid when the mood takes me

  if you copy the files from your disk to the c partition and mark it as
  active it should work 

 yeah i figured that but it doesnt seem to  well if thats the case
 ill give it another go tonight maybe come back with some error messages

 just to clarify for those who didnt understand me initially  i have a
 floppy drive installed but it doesnt physically work theres nowhere
 handy to pick one up where i am and i dont fancy waiting a few days for
 one to arrive from peats

 thanks for the answers
 ciaran

  you especially need iosys commandcom and msdossys
 
  your cd driver sys and read the autoexecbat and configsys files for
  hints on what you did with your boot floppy g

  hi folks
  the situation is this at home i have a pc with  gig hdds and no
  working floppy drive i have been running linux solely for the last
  year but recently got the urge to among other things play some of
  my windoze games i normally install the windows partition using a
  boot floppy which i have conveniently zipped up but i havent any way
  of writing or reading a floppy
  so how do i go about
   formatting a c drive with system files normally i would use
  format s c from the floppy
   installing the cdrom drivers my bootdisk i wrote it many years
  ago does this normally
   booting from the partition
 
  i wiped all my linux partitions from the first drive and created
  partitions for windows hda slackware and redhat i used cfdisk for
  this i made the first drive hda bootable i then installed the
  windows partition in lilo and reran lilo installed in mbr i copied
  the contents of bootzip to my new windows partition and tried to boot
  it  all i get is a garbled line of squiggles
 
  anyone any ideas i cant think of anywhere in athlone to get a new
  floppy drive this evening
 
  thanks
  ciaran
