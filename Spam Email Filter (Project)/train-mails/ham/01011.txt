  tony in essence is there a way to mark a destination folder
  tony for a message link or move without actually doing a move
  tony or link i couldnt see anything obvious

 right click on the folder label in the folder list

 in the main window the  key puts you into a change 
   folder mode the first time you use it after starting exmh
   hit a second  and you go to set a target mode  type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete
