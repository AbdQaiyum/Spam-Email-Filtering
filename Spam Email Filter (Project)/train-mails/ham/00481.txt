journals to disseminate in pdf in  the journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the electronic publishing conferences held biyearly
from  ep ep ep ep

todays reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance
since they dont directly discuss the web as an academic i find this
journal valuable since the papers are of generally high quality by top
researchers and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many web technologies  its one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies

rohit and adam might find the following papers especially relevant in the
context of their www evolution of document species paper
