what is the maildrop recipe you use with spamassassin  i was trying to
set mine up but i am running into a few difficulties

i think i will try spamassassin first and see how it goes and then
perhaps fold in razor is it easy to fold in

sunil


 here is my recipe for maildrop

  vipuls razor check
 
 log usrbinrazorcheck
 log razorcheck  returncode
 if  returncode   
 
   xfilter reformail axrazor spam
   log spam caught by vipuls razor
   to foldersspam
 

 i used this with razor version   im not sure if it was ever used with
 razor  i am now using spamassassin w razor  you may wish to remove
 the log statements once running

 i use both  spamassassin sa catches things that razor does not
 there were enough false positives with razor that i do not trust it
 alone after whitelisting all the newsletters i receive sa w razor
 does a very good job

 quoting sunil william savkar sunilinthespacecom
 hi

 i just finished installing and getting running maildrop with my
 virtual users  i was thinking to set up razor with maildrop as my
 first test of its filtering capabilities

 i have seen documentation out there for procmail but is there similar
 documentation for integrating maildrop with razor



 separately it looks like many people use spamassassin with razor  if
 i am using razor is there still an advantage to this



 thanks in advance



 sunil
