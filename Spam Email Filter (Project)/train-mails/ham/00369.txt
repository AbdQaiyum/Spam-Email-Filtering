  red hat linux advanced server provides many high end features such as
  support for asynchronous io now read io no longer needs to stall your
  application while waiting for completion

 can you provide a reference  i could find it myself but im too lazy

well i saw it on the compaq testdrive site then had to seriously dig on
the redhat site its in one of their whitepapers
httpwwwredhatcompdfasasrasmpdf


  could it be after  years without this feature unix finally
  catches up to
  windows and has io that doesnt totally suck for nontrivial apps no way

 do devpoll and freebsds kq event driven apis count imho true async
 io as implemented by windows  and beyond is pretty slick but the
 programming model is substantially more complex than programming to an
 event api like devpoll and true async does not buy much if the
 system call overhead is low as it is with linux

i havent used the fbsd poll as its not portable select and pollstill not
 are all that exist in the unix world redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either but its nice they are trying the windows io model does
definately blow the doors off the unix one but then they had select to
point at in its suckiness and anything would have been an improvement unix
is just now looking at its io model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so its gonna be years yet before a posix api comes out
of it bottom line is the do stuff when something happens model turned out
to be right and the unix look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look is not really working
so great anymore
