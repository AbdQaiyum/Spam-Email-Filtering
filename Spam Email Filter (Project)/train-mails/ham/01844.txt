janis ian a brave and talented recording artist and budding and talented 
science fiction writer has done a terrific interview with the slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry 

    seriously diversity is something record companies cant afford anymore  
    not the majors at any rate id go to this article posted at linux 
    journal which quotes a newsweet article july  by steven levy 
    saying so why are the record labels taking such a hard line my guess is 
    that its all about protecting their internetchallenged business model 
    their profit comes from blockbuster artists if the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology independent labels and artists would thriveto the 
    detriment of the labels which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next britney the smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    riaabacked economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in webcasting is inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation thats really it in a nutshell market 
    consolidation means the less artists they have to promote the less 
    ultimate dollars theyll spend the smaller the playlist the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone  because 
    thats all youll be able to find out there
