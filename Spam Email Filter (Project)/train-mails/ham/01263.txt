once upon a time roi wrote 

 same as in mplayer src package
 the with and without not working correctly
 i do without arts and it still want to install with arts

this time the problem seems to be that i overestimated xinelibs configure
script as it seems that it doesnt support disabling arts so if you have
artsdevel installed its support will be compiled in 

also i had made another mistake and added the configure option to disable
lirc ot xinelib when it should have been for xineui

all this is fixed in the upcoming fr release
