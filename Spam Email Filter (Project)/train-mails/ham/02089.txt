dan gillmor interviewed jack valenti last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing representing valentis beliefs as fairly as possible this 
week dan takes valentis arguments apart looking at what hollywoods agenda 
really entails 

    so the movie and music companies are going back to congress for another 
    helping they are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices  cripple pcs and other machines that 
    communicate so they cant make copies the copyright holders dont 
    explicitly allow amazingly the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights 

    here is what it all means to protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate the media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized to control the new medium as if its nothing 
    but a jazzedup television instead of accepting as they do today that a 
    certain amount of pennyante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the majorleague pirates they call every act of infringement  and some 
    things that arent infringement at all  an act of piracy or stealing 
    saying it doesnt make it so
