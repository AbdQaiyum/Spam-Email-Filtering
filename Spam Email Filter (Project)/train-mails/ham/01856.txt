no really my sinus infection which appeared to be gone flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way and i am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably dont bear repeating in a public forum i have the 
 doctors appointment that i should have made last round had i not 
convinced myself that its not that bad and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs im not making the same mistake this time ill 
be back this afternoon 

my email problems of yesterday have been resolved you can once again reach me 
at my normal address fdydiveintomarkorg 

kevin burton emailed me with another way to link to a foaf file from my rss 
feed it looks easier than previous suggestions and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an rss  or  feed but i worry about all these 
variations just as in real life where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing in the semantic web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements thats great for producers not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all 

for each domain rss feeds foaf files whatever somebody or some group 
needs to come along and document best practices we need better goaloriented 
documentation we have a lot of reference documentation taskoriented 
documentation but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in english how do i include personal information in 
my rss feed is a goaloriented question create a foaf file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your rss 
feed with as many examples as necessary is a goaloriented answer 
anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary
