 does anyone know when redhat  is going to be released
 i have seen some iso images of it around and i am trying to work out 
 if its near release

 null the third beta was out last week

 itll be an interesting release gnome  and gcc   both very new
large projects

 id not be putting it on any production machines for a while

 though many say redhat x releases are rubbish  its worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes not
just the installer so they are  for a reason
