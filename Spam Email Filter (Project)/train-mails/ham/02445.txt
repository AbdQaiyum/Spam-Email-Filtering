i think i understand the feeling  a few years ago i caught up with
a couple of old fiancs both now authors and notable in their
field  one is a minor celebrity  perhaps i should say was
because fame can be so fleeting and i do not know the
current status but she still commands buck on the lecture
circuit  i authored some technical material through the
years which are probably long forgotten  i am also notable
sort of kind of in some very narrow fields how many
mandobass artists could there be so have that
feather in my cap if i cared about it

i feel i am only a little jealous or depressed thinking about my
own accomplishments or lack thereof  what does
bug me is that these  probably have some real good
juicy stories and im not getting to hear any of them
thats one reason i love this list
