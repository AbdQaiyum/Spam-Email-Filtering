 easy ways to breath new life into any webpage


pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp its true
pask the ceos of yahoocom and america onlinenbsp theyll
brtell you its truenbsp send an email to terry dean or allen
brsays or jim daniels and ask them about itnbsp theyll agree
br that its truenbsp dont just take my word for it
pin fact you can contact any of the  folks online
brselling web marketing resources and they will all tell you
bremphatically without question no doubts whatsoever that
brit is absolutely true
pits true anyone can earn a living onlinenbsp really they
brcannbsp but it takes several very important components to
brjoin the  who are successful on the web
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp one of those necessities is a website
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp now your website does one of two things
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp it either makes the sale or it doesnt
pfor  of online businesses their websites simply do
brnot produce results
pand there is a very simple reason for poor performance
brpoor sales letters
pdoes your website convince people to make a purchase
brif not here are  easy ways to breathe new life into
bryour sales letter
p write your sales letter with an individual in mind
brgo ahead and pick out someone a real person to write your
brsales letter tonbsp doesnt matter if it is grandma or your
brnext door neighbor or your catnbsp write your sales letter
brjust like you are writing it to them personallynbsp why
brbecause when your potential customer reads it then it will
brseem personal almost like you wrote it with them in mind
brtoo often sales letters are written as if they were going
brto be read to an audience rather than one personnbsp keep your
brsales letters personal because one person at a time is
brgoing to read them
p use an illustration to get your point acrossnbsp in my
brsales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on
brthe side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
brconstantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
brbusinesses running i have compared the hype of easily
brmaking millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
bracross montana on a grizzly bearnbsp leads have read of how
brgetting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
brmarketing online people love a good story that pounds home
bra solid messagenbsp tell stories that illustrate a point you
brare trying to makenbsp emphasize a benefit by sharing an
braccount from the real worldnbsp it effectively creates
brinterest and further establishes the point
p create an interest in the reader from the very first
brlinenbsp your first line of the sales letter should
brimmediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
brmorenbsp go back to the beginning of this articlenbsp the first
brwords were its truenbsp i can guarantee you that either
brconsciously or subconsciously you thought whats true
brimmediately your mind wanted to know what i was talking
braboutnbsp before you even knew it you were right here 
brparagraphs into this articlenbsp carefully craft your first
brlinenbsp if you can immediately get them wanting to know more
bryouve got a winner
p use bullets people spend a lot of time reading bulleted
brlists in fact they often reread them over and over use
brbulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
brservice to spell out exactly what is included in your offer
bruse an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
breach line and create a sense of more length to the list
p launch into a bullet list immediatelynbsp shortly after
bryour opening line immediately give the reader a bullet
brlist of benefits to absorbnbsp hit them with your best shot
brpull out the big guns and stress just a few of the most
brimportant things the reader will discovernbsp by offering a
brkiller list early in your sales letter you will automatically
brcreate a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
brcopynbsp after all if they are already interested after the
brfirst list of benefits they will certainly be open to
brfinding out even more reasons why your product or service
brwill aid them
p just let it all flow outnbsp write down everything that
brenters your mind as you are writing your sales letter you
brcan edit it laternbsp if you just sit and start writing
breverything you know about your product or service and how it
brwill benefit your customer you will be amazed at how much
brinformation floods your mindnbsp write it all downnbsp then read
brthrough it  youll be able to add a lot more detail to
brmany of the pointsnbsp edit it after you have exhausted all
brof your ideas
p make your sales letter personalnbsp make sure that the
brwords you and your are at least  over i and my
bryour ad copy must be written about your customer not
bryourselfnbsp im not sure how the old advertising adage goes
brbut its something like this i dont care a thing about
bryour lawn mower i just care about my lawnnbsp leads arent
brinterested in you or your products they are interested in
brthemselves and their wants and needsnbsp when you are finished
brwith your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
brwebpage run a check at httpwwwkeywordcountcom and see
brwhat the ratio between you and your versus references to
bri me my etcnbsp its a free servicenbsp make sure its
brat least  in favor of the customer
p write like you speaknbsp forget all of those rules that
bryour grammar teacher taught younbsp write your sales letters
brin everyday language just like you would talk in person
brdont be afraid to begin sentences with and or because
brdont worry about ending a sentence with a preposition
brwrite like you speak your sales letter isnt the great
bramerican novel so dont write it like you are ernest
brhemingway
p use short paragraphs consisting of  sentences each
brlong copy works but long paragraphs do notnbsp use short
brparagraphs that lead into the next paragraph dont be
brafraid to use short sentencesnbsp like this one
por this
psee what i meannbsp shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
brthe reader longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
brforce the reader to get distracted
pnbsp stress the benefits not the featuresnbsp again
brreaders want the burning question answered whats in it
brfornbsp menbsp what need is it going to meet what want is it
brgoing to fillnbsp how is your product or service going to be
brof value or benefit to the readernbsp spell it outnbsp dont
brfocus on the features of your product or service  but
brrather how those features will add value to the life of your
brreader
pfor examplenbsp if you are selling automobile tires you may
brvery well have the largest assortment of tires in the world
brbut who cares i dont care about your selection but i
brdo care about keeping my monthold baby girl safe while
brwe are travelingnbsp so instead of focusing on your selection
bryou focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
brbecause you have a tire that will fit my car youre not
brselling tires youre selling safety for my family stress
brthe benefits not the features
p keep the reader interestednbsp some sales letters read
brlike they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can
brperform some complicated surgery on my wife they are
brfilled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to
brunderstandnbsp unless you are writing to a very targeted
braudience avoid using technical language that many readers
brmight not understand keep it simple using words language
brand information that are easy to understand and follow
p target your sales letternbsp when you are finished with
bryour final draft of the sales letter target it to a
brspecific audiencenbsp for example if you are selling a work
brat home product then rewrite the sales letter by adding
brwords in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
brwomen who are homemakersnbsp then rewrite the same sales
brletter and target it to college studentsnbsp write another
brletter targeting senior citizensnbsp still another could be
brwritten to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
brduring summer vacationnbsp the possibilities are endless
pall you need to do is add a few words here and there in
bryour ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
bris specifically designed for a target audience work only
br hours a week would become college students work only
br hours a weeknbsp your sales letter is now targeted upload
brall of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
bryou could easily target s of groups
pthen simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
brmediumsnbsp you could advertise the college students page
brin a campus ezinenbsp the senior citizens page could be
bradvertised at a retirement community message board
pby creating these targeted sales letters you can literally
bropen up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
brtonbsp and in their eyes it looks like the product was a
brmatch made for them
p make your ad copy easy to follownbsp use short sentences
brand paragraphs break up the sales letter with attention
brgrabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph one
brthing that i have always found to work very well in sales
brletters
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp is to use a pause like this
pstart the sentence on one line leaving the reader wanting
brto know more and then finishing up on the next line also
brif you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
brseveral different pages of your website use a catchy hook
brline at the end of each page to keep them clicking lets
brget you started down the road to success shall we click
brhere to continue
p use similes and metaphors for effectnbsp when the
brcustomer purchases your product they will generate a flood
brof traffic that would make noah start building another ark
brif they do not order today then they will feel like a cat
brthat let the mouse get awaynbsp use words to create a picture
brin the readers mindnbsp when you think of superman what
brcomes to mindnbsp immediately we remember that he is faster
brthan a speeding bulletnbsp more powerful than a locomotive
brable to leap tall buildings in a single bound see how
brword pictures stick in our minds
p focus on one product or servicenbsp dont try to sell
bryour customer multiple products at the same time it only
brconfuses the readernbsp keep your ad copy directed at one
brspecific product or servicenbsp then use other products and
brservices as backend products
p make it stand outnbsp dont kid yourselfnbsp there are
brhundreds maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
brsame thing you are doingnbsp how will you stand out among the
brcrowdnbsp your sales letter must inject personality it must
brbreathe of originalitynbsp your product or service is
brdifferent its not like all of the restnbsp it is unique
brright your sales letter must separate you from the
brcompetitionnbsp it must create a feeling of you wont find
brthis anywhere else
p be believable earn  in the next  hours
brdeletenbsp good grief do they think i am an idiot or
brsomethingnbsp get realnbsp dont make outrageous claims that
brare obviously not the truthnbsp youll ruin your reputation
brlet me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
brreversednbsp once you have been branded a liar you will
brnever be anything but a liarnbsp it doesnt matter if you
brlaunch the most respectable honest business available
branywhere people will always have doubt because they
brremember the crazy stuff youve said beforenbsp be believable
brdont exaggerate mislead stretch or distort the truth
p be specific dont generalize your information but
brrather be exactnbsp instead of over  tips for losing
brweight use  tips for losing weight by generalizing
brinformation it creates doubt and questions in the readers
brmindnbsp what am i really getting herenbsp does he even know
brwhen you use specific information the reader begins to
brthink this person must have countednbsp i know exactly what
bri can expectnbsp platitudes and generalities roll off the
brhuman understanding like water from a duck wrote claude
brhopkins in his classic book scientific advertising they
brleave no impression whatsoever
p be complete tell the reader everything they would
brwant to know about your product or servicenbsp answer all of
brtheir questions anything they would want to consider before
brmaking a purchasenbsp think about it from their point of view
brask yourself why wouldnt i buy thisnbsp then address that
brin your sales letternbsp remove anything that would keep the
brreader from making the purchase
p use testimonials to boost your salesnbsp share actual
brexcerpts from what your current customers are saying about
bryour product or service many websites have an entire
brsection or even a separate page that has endorsements and
brcompliments listednbsp satisfied customers remove some of the
brdoubt in the mind of the readernbsp if these people have
brfound a lot of value and benefit in the product then i
brprobably will toonbsp especially effective are testimonials
brfrom respected well known authorities within your target
brfield
p use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter
bra headline isnt just relegated to the beginning of your
brad copynbsp use them frequently but dont overusenbsp a well
brplaced headline regrabs the readers attention brings
brthem deeper into the letter and readies them for the next
brparagraph you will want to spend as much time working on
bryour headlines as you do the entire sales letternbsp they are
brthat important
p avoid asking stupid questionsnbsp wouldnt you like to
brmake  a year doesnt that sound great would
bryou like to be as successful as i amnbsp avoid any question
brthat insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
brfeel like they are inferior
p offer a freebie even if the customer doesnt buy
brif the customer decides he or she isnt going to make a
brpurchase then you want to followup with them later to try
brto influence them to buy in the futurenbsp by offering a free
britem you cannbsp request their email address in order to
brobtain the freebienbsp by doing this you can now followup
brwith the customer for a potential future sale
bradditionally you can continue the sales process by having
bryour ad copy banners flyers etc within the free item
brand of course if your free item is a high quality useful
brproduct or service which impresses the customer they
brprobably will be back as a customer soon
p use bonuses to overwhelm the readernbsp one of the things
brthat i have found very effective in writing sales letters
bris to include bonus items that outvalue the actual product
bri am offeringnbsp ginsu made this one famous they were
brselling a set of steak knives but before the commercial
brwas finished you had so many bonus items on the table
brit was hard to refuse make sure you provide quality
brbonuses and not some worthless outdated junk that damages
brthe credibility of your main offer
p use connective phrases like but wait theres more
brand but thats not allnbsp these phrases effectively lead
brthe reader from one paragraph to the next particularly
brwhen the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits or
brleads into bonus itemsnbsp again the idea is more and more
brvalue and benefits to the reader
p always include a deadlinenbsp by including a deadline
bryou create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer
brif i dont order within  hours then i wont get the
brbonusesnbsp oh no there are only  items remaining
brive got to hurrynbsp let the customer know what they will
brbe missing out on if they dont make the deadline remember
brthey wont miss out on your products or bonuses they will
brmiss out on all of the benefits of your products deadlines
brare very effectivenbsp every sales letter should have one
p tell them exactly how to ordernbsp be clear as to the
brorder process point them towards the order linknbsp tell
brthem what methods you offer ie credit cards checks
bretcnbsp make this process as simple and clear as can be
brif it takes more than  steps most people wont continue
pnbsp explain when the product will be deliverednbsp how
brquickly will the order be processednbsp when will the order be
bravailablenbsp let the customer know exactly what they can
brexpect when they place their ordernbsp the more specific you
brcan be here the betternbsp let them know that you have a
brsystem in placenbsp operators are standing bynbsp their order
brwill be handled properlynbsp tell them
p offer a money back guaranteenbsp take away their last
brreason to hold backnbsp offer a no questions asked  day
brguaranteenbsp most people may not realize this but in most
brcases its the law of the landnbsp you are required to give
brthem their money back if they are not satisfied with the
brproduct or servicenbsp since its the law anyway why not make
brit a benefit let them know that they are purchasing your
brproduct or service riskfree
p instruct them to respond immediatelynbsp many people
brjust need to read those words act nownbsp order today
brclick here to instantly place your ordernbsp youve got them
brthis far now tell them what you want them to donbsp get them
brto act fastnbsp have you ever heard a mail order commercial
bron television that didnt prompt the viewer to order right
brway
p include a post scriptnbsp people will always read the
brpsnbsp always in fact the ps is one of the most important
brparts of your sales letter whynbsp because in many cases the
brvisitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
brend of your page to see how much it is going to costnbsp a
brps is a perfect place to recap your offer so when they
brsee your price tag they will also see a very detailed
brdescription of what they will receive for their money use
bryour ps to restate your offer in detail
p include a second post scriptnbsp you better believe
brif they read the first ps they will read a ppsnbsp use
brthis post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
branother bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
brmake them want to ordernbsp i guarantee you they will read it
puse these  tips and i guarantee you that you will see
bra significant increase in the amount of responses you
brreceive from your sales lettersnbsp in fact it would be
brimpossible for your responses to not improve

brcannbsp but it takes several very important components to
brjoin the  who are successful on the web
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp one of those necessities is a website
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp now your website does one of two things
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp it either makes the sale or it doesnt
pfor  of online businesses their websites simply do
brnot produce results
pand there is a very simple reason for poor performance
brpoor sales letters
pdoes your website convince people to make a purchase
brif not here are  easy ways to breathe new life into
bryour sales letter
p write your sales letter with an individual in mind
brgo ahead and pick out someone a real person to write your
brsales letter tonbsp doesnt matter if it is grandma or your
brnext door neighbor or your catnbsp write your sales letter
brjust like you are writing it to them personallynbsp why
brbecause when your potential customer reads it then it will
brseem personal almost like you wrote it with them in mind
brtoo often sales letters are written as if they were going
brto be read to an audience rather than one personnbsp keep your
brsales letters personal because one person at a time is
brgoing to read them
p use an illustration to get your point acrossnbsp in my
brsales letters i have told stories about my car stalling on
brthe side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
brconstantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
brbusinesses running i have compared the hype of easily
brmaking millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
bracross montana on a grizzly bearnbsp leads have read of how
brgetting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
brmarketing online people love a good story that pounds home
bra solid messagenbsp tell stories that illustrate a point you
brare trying to makenbsp emphasize a benefit by sharing an
braccount from the real worldnbsp it effectively creates
brinterest and further establishes the point
p create an interest in the reader from the very first
brlinenbsp your first line of the sales letter should
brimmediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
brmorenbsp go back to the beginning of this articlenbsp the first
brwords were its truenbsp i can guarantee you that either
brconsciously or subconsciously you thought whats true
brimmediately your mind wanted to know what i was talking
braboutnbsp before you even knew it you were right here 
brparagraphs into this articlenbsp carefully craft your first
brlinenbsp if you can immediately get them wanting to know more
bryouve got a winner
p use bullets people spend a lot of time reading bulleted
brlists in fact they often reread them over and over use
brbulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
brservice to spell out exactly what is included in your offer
bruse an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
breach line and create a sense of more length to the list
p launch into a bullet list immediatelynbsp shortly after
bryour opening line immediately give the reader a bullet
brlist of benefits to absorbnbsp hit them with your best shot
brpull out the big guns and stress just a few of the most
brimportant things the reader will discovernbsp by offering a
brkiller list early in your sales letter you will automatically
brcreate a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
brcopynbsp after all if they are already interested after the
brfirst list of benefits they will certainly be open to
brfinding out even more reasons why your product or service
brwill aid them
p just let it all flow outnbsp write down everything that
brenters your mind as you are writing your sales letter you
brcan edit it laternbsp if you just sit and start writing
breverything you know about your product or service and how it
brwill benefit your customer you will be amazed at how much
brinformation floods your mindnbsp write it all downnbsp then read
brthrough it  youll be able to add a lot more detail to
brmany of the pointsnbsp edit it after you have exhausted all
brof your ideas
p make your sales letter personalnbsp make sure that the
brwords you and your are at least  over i and my
bryour ad copy must be written about your customer not
bryourselfnbsp im not sure how the old advertising adage goes
brbut its something like this i dont care a thing about
bryour lawn mower i just care about my lawnnbsp leads arent
brinterested in you or your products they are interested in
brthemselves and their wants and needsnbsp when you are finished
brwith your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
brwebpage run a check at httpwwwkeywordcountcom and see
brwhat the ratio between you and your versus references to
bri me my etcnbsp its a free servicenbsp make sure its
brat least  in favor of the customer
p write like you speaknbsp forget all of those rules that
bryour grammar teacher taught younbsp write your sales letters
brin everyday language just like you would talk in person
brdont be afraid to begin sentences with and or because
brdont worry about ending a sentence with a preposition
brwrite like you speak your sales letter isnt the great
bramerican novel so dont write it like you are ernest
brhemingway
p use short paragraphs consisting of  sentences each
brlong copy works but long paragraphs do notnbsp use short
brparagraphs that lead into the next paragraph dont be
brafraid to use short sentencesnbsp like this one
por this
psee what i meannbsp shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
brthe reader longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
brforce the reader to get distracted
pnbsp stress the benefits not the featuresnbsp again
brreaders want the burning question answered whats in it
brfornbsp menbsp what need is it going to meet what want is it
brgoing to fillnbsp how is your product or service going to be
brof value or benefit to the readernbsp spell it outnbsp dont
brfocus on the features of your product or service  but
brrather how those features will add value to the life of your
brreader
pfor examplenbsp if you are selling automobile tires you may
brvery well have the largest assortment of tires in the world
brbut who cares i dont care about your selection but i
brdo care about keeping my monthold baby girl safe while
brwe are travelingnbsp so instead of focusing on your selection
bryou focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
brbecause you have a tire that will fit my car youre not
brselling tires youre selling safety for my family stress
brthe benefits not the features
p keep the reader interestednbsp some sales letters read
brlike they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can
brperform some complicated surgery on my wife they are
brfilled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to
brunderstandnbsp unless you are writing to a very targeted
braudience avoid using technical language that many readers
brmight not understand keep it simple using words language
brand information that are easy to understand and follow
p target your sales letternbsp when you are finished with
bryour final draft of the sales letter target it to a
brspecific audiencenbsp for example if you are selling a work
brat home product then rewrite the sales letter by adding
brwords in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
brwomen who are homemakersnbsp then rewrite the same sales
brletter and target it to college studentsnbsp write another
brletter targeting senior citizensnbsp still another could be
brwritten to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
brduring summer vacationnbsp the possibilities are endless
pall you need to do is add a few words here and there in
bryour ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
bris specifically designed for a target audience work only
br hours a week would become college students work only
br hours a weeknbsp your sales letter is now targeted upload
brall of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
bryou could easily target s of groups
pthen simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
brmediumsnbsp you could advertise the college students page
brin a campus ezinenbsp the senior citizens page could be
bradvertised at a retirement community message board
pby creating these targeted sales letters you can literally
bropen up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
brtonbsp and in their eyes it looks like the product was a
brmatch made for them
p make your ad copy easy to follownbsp use short sentences
brand paragraphs break up the sales letter with attention
brgrabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph one
brthing that i have always found to work very well in sales
brletters
pnbspnbspnbspnbsp is to use a pause like this
pstart the sentence on one line leaving the reader wanting
brto know more and then finishing up on the next line also
brif you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
brseveral different pages of your website use a catchy hook
brline at the end of each page to keep them clicking lets
brget you started down the road to success shall we click
brhere to continue
p use similes and metaphors for effectnbsp when the
brcustomer purchases your product they will generate a flood
brof traffic that would make noah start building another ark
brif they do not order today then they will feel like a cat
brthat let the mouse get awaynbsp use words to create a picture
brin the readers mindnbsp when you think of superman what
brcomes to mindnbsp immediately we remember that he is faster
brthan a speeding bulletnbsp more powerful than a locomotive
brable to leap tall buildings in a single bound see how
brword pictures stick in our minds
p focus on one product or servicenbsp dont try to sell
bryour customer multiple products at the same time it only
brconfuses the readernbsp keep your ad copy directed at one
brspecific product or servicenbsp then use other products and
brservices as backend products
p make it stand outnbsp dont kid yourselfnbsp there are
brhundreds maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
brsame thing you are doingnbsp how will you stand out among the
brcrowdnbsp your sales letter must inject personality it must
brbreathe of originalitynbsp your product or service is
brdifferent its not like all of the restnbsp it is unique
brright your sales letter must separate you from the
brcompetitionnbsp it must create a feeling of you wont find
brthis anywhere else
p be believable earn  in the next  hours
brdeletenbsp good grief do they think i am an idiot or
brsomethingnbsp get realnbsp dont make outrageous claims that
brare obviously not the truthnbsp youll ruin your reputation
brlet me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
brreversednbsp once you have been branded a liar you will
brnever be anything but a liarnbsp it doesnt matter if you
brlaunch the most respectable honest business available
branywhere people will always have doubt because they
brremember the crazy stuff youve said beforenbsp be believable
brdont exaggerate mislead stretch or distort the truth
p be specific dont generalize your information but
brrather be exactnbsp instead of over  tips for losing
brweight use  tips for losing weight by generalizing
brinformation it creates doubt and questions in the readers
brmindnbsp what am i really getting herenbsp does he even know
brwhen you use specific information the reader begins to
brthink this person must have countednbsp i know exactly what
bri can expectnbsp platitudes and generalities roll off the
brhuman understanding like water from a duck wrote claude
brhopkins in his classic book scientific advertising they
brleave no impression whatsoever
p be complete tell the reader everything they would
brwant to know about your product or servicenbsp answer all of
brtheir questions anything they would want to consider before
brmaking a purchasenbsp think about it from their point of view
brask yourself why wouldnt i buy thisnbsp then address that
brin your sales letternbsp remove anything that would keep the
brreader from making the purchase
p use testimonials to boost your salesnbsp share actual
brexcerpts from what your current customers are saying about
bryour product or service many websites have an entire
brsection or even a separate page that has endorsements and
brcompliments listednbsp satisfied customers remove some of the
brdoubt in the mind of the readernbsp if these people have
brfound a lot of value and benefit in the product then i
brprobably will toonbsp especially effective are testimonials
brfrom respected well known authorities within your target
brfield
p use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter
bra headline isnt just relegated to the beginning of your
brad copynbsp use them frequently but dont overusenbsp a well
brplaced headline regrabs the readers attention brings
brthem deeper into the letter and readies them for the next
brparagraph you will want to spend as much time working on
bryour headlines as you do the entire sales letternbsp they are
brthat important
p avoid asking stupid questionsnbsp wouldnt you like to
brmake  a year doesnt that sound great would
bryou like to be as successful as i amnbsp avoid any question
brthat insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
brfeel like they are inferior
p offer a freebie even if the customer doesnt buy
brif the customer decides he or she isnt going to make a
brpurchase then you want to followup with them later to try
brto influence them to buy in the futurenbsp by offering a free
britem you cannbsp request their email address in order to
brobtain the freebienbsp by doing this you can now followup
brwith the customer for a potential future sale
bradditionally you can continue the sales process by having
bryour ad copy banners flyers etc within the free item
brand of course if your free item is a high quality useful
brproduct or service which impresses the customer they
brprobably will be back as a customer soon
p use bonuses to overwhelm the readernbsp one of the things
brthat i have found very effective in writing sales letters
bris to include bonus items that outvalue the actual product
bri am offeringnbsp ginsu made this one famous they were
brselling a set of steak knives but before the commercial
brwas finished you had so many bonus items on the table
brit was hard to refuse make sure you provide quality
brbonuses and not some worthless outdated junk that damages
brthe credibility of your main offer
p use connective phrases like but wait theres more
brand but thats not allnbsp these phrases effectively lead
brthe reader from one paragraph to the next particularly
brwhen the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits or
brleads into bonus itemsnbsp again the idea is more and more
brvalue and benefits to the reader
p always include a deadlinenbsp by including a deadline
bryou create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer
brif i dont order within  hours then i wont get the
brbonusesnbsp oh no there are only  items remaining
brive got to hurrynbsp let the customer know what they will
brbe missing out on if they dont make the deadline remember
brthey wont miss out on your products or bonuses they will
brmiss out on all of the benefits of your products deadlines
brare very effectivenbsp every sales letter should have one
p tell them exactly how to ordernbsp be clear as to the
brorder process point them towards the order linknbsp tell
brthem what methods you offer ie credit cards checks
bretcnbsp make this process as simple and clear as can be
brif it takes more than  steps most people wont continue
pnbsp explain when the product will be deliverednbsp how
brquickly will the order be processednbsp when will the order be
bravailablenbsp let the customer know exactly what they can
brexpect when they place their ordernbsp the more specific you
brcan be here the betternbsp let them know that you have a
brsystem in placenbsp operators are standing bynbsp their order
brwill be handled properlynbsp tell them
p offer a money back guaranteenbsp take away their last
brreason to hold backnbsp offer a no questions asked  day
brguaranteenbsp most people may not realize this but in most
brcases its the law of the landnbsp you are required to give
brthem their money back if they are not satisfied with the
brproduct or servicenbsp since its the law anyway why not make
brit a benefit let them know that they are purchasing your
brproduct or service riskfree
p instruct them to respond immediatelynbsp many people
brjust need to read those words act nownbsp order today
brclick here to instantly place your ordernbsp youve got them
brthis far now tell them what you want them to donbsp get them
brto act fastnbsp have you ever heard a mail order commercial
bron television that didnt prompt the viewer to order right
brway
p include a post scriptnbsp people will always read the
brpsnbsp always in fact the ps is one of the most important
brparts of your sales letter whynbsp because in many cases the
brvisitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
brend of your page to see how much it is going to costnbsp a
brps is a perfect place to recap your offer so when they
brsee your price tag they will also see a very detailed
brdescription of what they will receive for their money use
bryour ps to restate your offer in detail
p include a second post scriptnbsp you better believe
brif they read the first ps they will read a ppsnbsp use
brthis post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
branother bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
brmake them want to ordernbsp i guarantee you they will read it
puse these  tips and i guarantee you that you will see
bra significant increase in the amount of responses you
brreceive from your sales lettersnbsp in fact it would be
brimpossible for your responses to not improve
