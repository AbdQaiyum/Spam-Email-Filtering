 sponsorship how and why veuve clicquot speaks
    interview with naomi hancock pr manager veuve clicquot uk  july 




  on the occasion of the veuve clicquot gold cup polo in west sussex
naomi hancock reveals veuve clicquots communication strategy

veuve clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the
uk for the last  years this has been to associate the brand with the
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the english summer 

known locally as the english season

veuve clicquot has become the champagne of the season weve adapted our
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion and attitudes to these

events which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport



  does your company consider sponsorship a key marketingcommunication
tool

absolutely sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the

brand but we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where
the addition does not add real value to the event and vicaversa we
believe in investing nurturing and improving over time


  can you describe your sponsorship strategy

we aim to maximise the perception of veuve clicquot as the champagne of
the season everything we do is designed to build a partnership and
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners in their own creation and
development of their events our buzz word is integration as we seek to
make the season central to our marketing mix


  can you describe your sponsorship decisionmaking process

we usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our
mother company in france we have flexibility  within our budget and the

frame of the season  to undertake what we sense to match our values and
the image of veuve clicquot our role in london is to screen whatever
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally

we have a dedicated pr group at veuve clicquot which makes all decisions
related to our sponsorship above a certain threshold our headoffice wil
l
like to be involved in such a decision


  what are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy

return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment
decision we would only undertake sponsorship in seasonrelated events
this is our rule and frame of investment


  what objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship

within the season we are especially looking to achieve visibility vise

vis our audience imagetransfer media coverage all national press
magazine of all kinds

awareness is also key for veuve clicquot so we look to find events that
complement those that we already have and extend our appeal to people of

similar status but differing interests


  please describe one of your sponsorships

the eighth annual veuve clicquot gold cup polo held this month at cowdra
y
park in west sussex is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by

veuve clicquot uk each year this successful sponsorship earns veuve
clicquot tremendous media coverage fabulous exposure to our core target
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the

king of sports


  whats your approximate sponsorship spend per year

significant without giving figures we can say that we spend a large
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of veuve
clicquot as the champagne of the season because this is where we are
getting a good return on our investment


  how do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship
