dear sir 
  
i am mr 
thema ordi manager of billsexchange at the foreign remittance 
department of absa bank limited in my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of us twelve point five million us 
dollars only in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who 
died along with his entire family on november  in a ghastly plane 
crash since we got information about his death we have been expecting 
his nextofkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless somebody applied for it as nextofkin or relation to 
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines unfortunately 
nobody has come foward to claim this money 
  
it is based on this that some officials in my departement and i have 
decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you hence 
my contacting you we want you to present yourself as the nextofkin 
or relation of the deceased so that the fund can be remitted into your 
account 
  
moreover we do not want the money to go into the government account 
as unclaimed bill the banking law and guidelines here stipulate that 
any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years is deemed 
closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government 
treasury account 
  
now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transfered into 
the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before december 
 the reason for requesting you to present yourself as nextofkin 
is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a 
foreigner 
  
the mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your 
account  to my colleagues and i for the role you will be expected 
to play in this deal we have agreed to give you thirty percent  
of the total sum and  for the expenses we are going to encounter by 
the two parties at the course of this transactiontherefore you are 
expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to 
participatte in this business 
  
after receiving your reply you will be communicated to with the exact 
steps to take 
  
i expect your urgent response either by email to othemacom    
 to enable us conclude this transaction on your reply i shall call you and give 
you my phone number for security reasons
urgently 
  
please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for 
security reasons 
  
kind personal regards
