even when the market takes a  odd point dive you can still make money
in the stock market if you know what you are doing

if you dont know what you are doing follow people who do

this week you could have made

up to  using the lazy daytrader system

one stock that you would have found immediately was a stock that was
trading at  until a large company announced that it was offering 
for the shares

what do you think happened to the value of the shares

within the same day they went up to   profit in one day

there were  more examples like it this week which you would have found
within  seconds with the lazy daytrader system
