transact with you but first permit me to say that i
do not know you you are receiving this mail via blind
carbon copy of email addresses which i obtained from a
simple internet search you are therefore not obliged
to reply however if you do and the conditions are
right you will be amply compensated it is also
pertinent to add that i am using an assumed name and
free web based email addresses for my personal
protection 
 
in order to give you a background of this business
transaction please check the website

before proceeding further please permit me to give
you more background on the abacha family millions as

i have taken some pains to give you readings on the
abacha family fortunes they are of  course a matter
of public record and conclusively proves indeed that
general sani abacha transferred billions of dollars
out of nigeria  however it is conceivable and even
logical that not all of the fortune has been
discovered or frozen by foreign governments in
sympathy and on the request of the current government
of nigeria and this is a fact

the truth of the matter is that much more of the
abacha fortunes are still hidden  their location a
closely guarded secret her excellency hajia
abachawidow of gen sani abacha exhead of
state of nigeria who died june  
and her immediate family are under house arrest in
nigeria it is therefore my job to search out a
reliable person a complete stranger to help
transfersecure a negotiated amount from the still
hidden millions of dollars  the right person must
pass a background check in order to avoid my being
betrayed to the authorities as happened in the past
it is now obvious why i will be using an assumed name
for the moment all precautions will be taken to avoid
leakages though i am using the internet which is
largely unsafe as soon as i get a reliable
candidate i will introduce security measures for
every bodys protection for the moment i am simply a
contact person for the real abacha family

in sum the person i am looking for is an individual
or corporate body that is able to provide one or more
bank accounts into which arrangements will be made to
transfer us to us every
week the routine periodic transfers in small
instalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in
the wrong quarters these transfers will be secure and
properly legal and with all proper bank
documentation the right person may need to establish 
freshnew receiving bank accounts free from legal or
financial encumbrances persons with bad credit rating
 undischarged bankrupts companies in receivership
and minors need not reply because of the stature and
confidentiality of this proposed transaction a
successful candidate will receive  of all
transfers other conditions including maximum secrecy
and confidentiality  apply 

if you are interested in helping this family and if
you can meet our strict conditions please reply to
all email addresses listed below in your reply please
include your phone fax and contact address in the
event you do not meet our conditions after a brief
back ground check you will be communicated
accordingly please before replying  take your time
to go through all the links and investigate thoroughly
all the foregoing this is a serious proposal despite
the medium in which you are receiving my message

looking forward to your reply
