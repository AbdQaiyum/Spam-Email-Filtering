greetings

if youre thinking about a new job nows the time to
aggressively pick up your search many people slow
their job search donw in summer months when in fact
its the best time to look

heres why  many companies implement a new direction
or strategy at the first of the year resulting in a
first of the year hiring surge by mid year with
results in hand companies start hiring again to
expand on or adjust for the results of their first of
the year plans

while employers start hiring job seekers start
slowing their search efforts down this creates an
optimal job seeking environment of more jobs and less
competition

to best take advantage of this situation you should give
yourself massive exposure by signing up to all the top
career sites as soon as possible of course it will take
a little time but its well worth it the top career
sites are visited by  million employers and recruiters
daily  and collectively list millions of jobs

youll find this service at httpstartresumerabbitcom

 minutes and youll be instantly seen on monstercom

when searching for a new job its important to work
smart and cover a lot of ground todays serious job
seeker must take a multipronged approach to succeed
this should include networking reading all the
classifieds posting your resume on all the top career
sites and searching job listings on these sites daily

we recommend you try httpstartresumerabbitcom

from mid november to mid january the holidays have
a slowing down effect on hiring since the job search
process can often be several months waiting until the
end of summer to get started may push your new job off
well after the new year  nows the optimum time to
aggressively mount your search

sincerely
