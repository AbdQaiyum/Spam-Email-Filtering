if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then youbr
will have a money judgment against thembr
br
you are happy you won but you will soon find out thebr
shocking fact quotits now up to you to collect on thebr
judgmentquot the court does not require the loser to pay youbr
the court will not even help you you must trace the loserbr
down find their assets their employment bank accountsbr
real estate stocks and bonds etcbr
br
very few people know how to find these assets or what to dobr
when they are found the result is that millions ofbr
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgottenbr

br
today our company and our associates have over br
million dollars in money judgments that we are currentlybr
processing of this  million  million is in the formbr
of joint ventures between our firm and our associatesbr
joint ventures are where we make our money we only breakbr
even when our course is purchased we make a  margin onbr
the reports we supply to our associates our reportingbr
capability is so extensive that government agencies policebr
officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to usbr
for reportsbr
br
br
many of our associates already have real estate liens inbr
force of between  million to over  million dollarsbr
legally this means that when the properties are sold orbr
refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is br
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgmentsbr
annual interest on  million at  translates tobr
 annually in interest income not counting thebr
payment of the principalbr
br
our associates earn half of this amount or  perbr
year this is just for interest not counting principlebr
and not counting the compounding of the interest which canbr
add substantial additional income typically companies arebr
sold for  times earnings just based on simple interestbr
an associate with  million in real estate liens could sellbr
their business for approximately  million dollarsbr
br
 of all of our associates work out of their home br
are women and  are part time br
br
one of the benefits of working in this field is that you arebr
not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take offbr
for a month on vacation then go the judgments you arebr
working on will be there when you return the judgmentsbr
are still in force they do not disappearbr
br
the way we train you is nonconfrontational you use yourbr
computer and telephone to do most of the processing youbr
never confront the debtor the debtor doesnt know who youbr
are you are not a collection agencybr
br
simply stated the steps to successful money processingbr
are as followsbr
br
mail our recommended letter to companies and individualsbr
with money judgments we train you how to find out whobr
to write tobr
br
 to  of the firms and people you write will call youbr
and ask for your help they call you you dont call thembr
unless you want tobr
br
you send them an agreement supplied in the course tobr
sign which splits every dollar you collect  to you andbr
 to them this applies no matter if the judgment is forbr
 or br
br
you then go online to our computers to find the debtorbr
and their assets we offer over  powerful reports tobr
assist you they range from credit reports from all threebr
credit bureaus to bank account locates employmentbr
locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etcbr
the prices of our reports are very low typically  tobr
 of what other firms charge for example we chargebr
 for an individuals credit report when some otherbr
companies charge br
br
once you find the debtor and their assets you filebr
garnishments and liens on the assets you have locatedbr
standard fill in the blanks forms are included in thebr
coursebr
br
when you receive the assets you keep  and send  tobr
the original judgment holderbr
br
once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction ofbr
judgment to the court included in the coursebr
