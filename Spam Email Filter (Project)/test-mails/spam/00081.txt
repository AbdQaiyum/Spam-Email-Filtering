 ways to create a unique website


internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design this is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites these
five points will help you come up with a oneofakind design
for your website

 navigation system

deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else i would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas look at webmasterbase 
httpwwwwebmasterbasecom for example there is a list 
of categories on the left and information about the network 
on the top bar

it is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because

 people see the top of the page first
 if you have a lot of content on one page the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page away from the visitor

 color scheme

when you are choosing colors make sure they contrast for
example do not use bright green and florescent pink some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white

a wonderful utility that is webbased and free is color schemer
httpwwwgodigitalstudioscomwwwcolor created by aaron
epstein many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors try doing a search on freewarefiles 
httpwwwfreewarefilescom tucows httpwwwtucowscom
or downloadcom httpwwwdownloadcom for color schemer

 content window

this is the brain of the website make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand

also provide your own original content people do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say they want to hear what 
you want to say while it might be time consuming to write
your own content it sure is worth it

to find content for your website try searching at
ezinearticles httpwwwezinearticlescom other people may
have used the articles but if you become good friends with the
authors they may send you new content as they write it be
careful though do not use too much content from other 
authors as mentioned above

 fonts

several types of fonts exist the first one i will discuss is
fixed width or monospace similar to courier or courier new
fixed width fonts are good for displaying code like html

another type of font is called sans serif it is similar to
arial windows or helvetica macintosh this font can be 
used for long pieces of text

the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs
or curves in each letter often this font is called times
windows or georgia macintosh this font like sans serif
is often used for long blocks of text it is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter making it
easier to read

 advertising

ah everybodys favorite advertising this is one of thing 
that almost every website has the most common type is what 
is known as banner advertising it is called that because it is 
long and thin like a paper banner how long you ask the 
generic kind is  pixels wide by  pixels high

new sizes however are being used take for example the new
style called skyscraper  so called for a reason it looks
like a skyscraper it is tall about  pixels but not too
wide about  pixels

finding a way to place advertising can be tricky banners 
used to be placed and still are only at the top of the page
nevertheless banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page at the bottom or along the side

    conclusion

these are only five things to consider when designing a
website there are many others however let me know what
