internet success through simplicity


brevery day of the week i get questions from people all  
 brover the world including my no bs gimg members  
 brwanting to know some of the most valuable secrets 
 brto my ongoing internet success
 br
 brlet me say above all else i dont believe there are any 
 brtrue secrets to success on the net what you do to 
 brbecome successful in the online world is not a secret 
 brin my opinion most successful people follow simple clear 
 brrepeatedlyproven strategies to succeed whether on the 
 brnet or off
 br
 brbut when it comes to someone asking for advice 
 brconsultation or simply asking whats your secret 
 bri have to blush  say 
 br
 brpersistence and personality
 br
 brof course i always follow the advice with my own little 
 brdisclaimer what makes me successful may not work the 
 brsame for you   your first lesson is to get over 
 brthe deepseeded idea that success  of any kind in  
 brmy opinion  is somehow an unknown unattainable secret
 br
 brclearly it is not its not unknown its not unattainable 
 brits not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches
 br
 brone thing that gets to me so often in my work as an 
 brinternet consultant author and internet success 
 brstrategist is that so many people on the net seem to 
 brhave this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 brbetween themselves and success on the net its 
 bralmost as if theyve been barraged by so many claims 
 brof what works and what doesnt work and so many 
 brlong complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 brtheir online venture that success is the  brequivelant of a foot high brick wall
 br
 brits not that difficult my friends it is not that complicated

br
brour web site is initially designed to get leads build 
branding and provide informationwith a  month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart 
we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site
our site has been up less than  months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service
the growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyones expectationscertainly mine and 
ive been in this business for  years the internet is not 
dead in the horse business it is just getting its legs and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
online as well our site the first weve developed has 
exceeded our expectations and we arent satisfied with it 
yetwe just wanted to get it there for information
br jeff and rebecca marks a hrefhttpwwwgrandchampioncomhttpwwwgrandchampioncoma
p
brbranding while quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
zesto is our most challenging task
brzestocom ranks very high and most often  or  on 
all major search engines and directories even yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto the problem is simply thatwho if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products citrus peel are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions
brfortunately owning a non generic domain short easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless
