hi there

i recently came across a copy of your resume i found on the 
internet in case youre back on the market you should check
out this new web service that instantly posts your resume to
over  career websites

you fill out one online form and immediately you can be seen
by over  million employers and recruiters daily it works

in about  minutes youll be posted to all the major sites
like monster careerbuilder hotjobs dice jobcom and
more itll save you  hours in research and data entry

check out httpstartresumerabbitcom  i think youll
like it you dont even need a current resume

its a tough job market right now so if youve got a good
job hold on to it but these days its smart to have a few
irons in the fire too that only happens by being in all the
right places at all the right times so even if you do it by
hand get maximum exposure and be found on as many career
sites as possible

just food for thought

best wishes
