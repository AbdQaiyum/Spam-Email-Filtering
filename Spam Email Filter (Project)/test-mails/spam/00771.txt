	arent asian pacfic americans apas accorded equal 
opportunity already  unfortunately no  apas are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently  

	equal opportunity means for every man woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them  statistics mostly gathered by government 
studies show that aas have only  the opportunity of all 
other americans to rise to the top in the academic world 
corporate world the federal government  there seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to aas developing to the maximal of 
their potentials    a glass ceiling

	lets look at a concrete case  a lot of our best people are 
employed in universities  their average performance has been 
outstanding  whats their chance of rising to the top  

	university administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities  hence the ratio of administrators  faculty  
professionals broken down to races is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by american citizens of different races  
nationwide that ratio for blacks nonhispanic is   that is 
for every  black faculty and professionals there are  black 
administrators  the ratio for native american is  for white 
nonhispanic is  and for hispanic is   however it is 
only  for asian american  get on the web and check it out 
for yourself  source  dept of education  wwwedgovnces 
pubshtml table bf

	the above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
enlightened academic world  the situation in the corporate 
world state and federal governments is worse  

	in email    we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation a more perfect union   there has 
already been progress on account of that strategy  behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered owing
significantly to the blocvote organized and delivered by  in 
the  election
