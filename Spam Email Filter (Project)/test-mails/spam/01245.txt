pfont facearial strong of the worldwide gross national product of more than  billion us   more than  us per year more than  billion us per daystrongfontpbr

plifont face arial strongthefont colorredbuadvantages bufontof the technology developed by usstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial stronga the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of autoinsurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantiallystrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongbas per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year  they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression
by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year  at allstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongc this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhancedstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongas and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be  years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be 
 billion us x  days x  years   billion usstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongd our technology will ensure that at least seventyfive percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that  billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure furtherstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial stronge at the current levels more than  million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than  million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ie life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels 
 million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billionstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongf if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kindstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongg considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankindstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongh the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a prerequisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in futurestrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongi as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also  strongfontpbr

plifont facearial strong among other things we have the following options available to us font colorredbuoptionsbufont
available to us bufontpbr

pfont facearial colorredbua outright salebufontpbr

pfont facearial stronga immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration strongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongb further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a strongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongthe process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price strongfontpbr

pfont facearial colorredbub licencing optionsbufontpbr

pfont facearial strongiu new vehiclesu granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis strongfontpbr

pfont facearial strongiiu conversion of existing vehiclesu  to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than  billion vehicles all over the world strongfontpbr

pfont facearial colorredbuc  combined optionsbufontpbr

pfont facearial stronga collaborative arrangement with some private andor government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a predecided sharing partnership arrangementstrongfontpbr

plifont facearial strongthe font colorredbueconomicsfontbu of the  project will be as follows strongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong in case anyall processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design offont colorredbu new vehiclesbufont and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than  to  and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalationstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong in case the font colorred buexisting vehiclesbufont are modified the cost involved will be approximately  to  of the value of the vehicle 
but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection providedstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protectivestrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong there are more than  billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of nonmotorized ehiclesstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there fromstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiencystrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of  us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth  billion usstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting datestrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of  billion us per year over the next three yearsstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted online on receipt of online payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehiclestrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the enduser as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensingstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend andor estimatestrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correctstrongfontpbr

pfont facearial strong we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point more details including website references are available with us and can be provided if required
