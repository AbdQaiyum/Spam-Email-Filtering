subject info on using linux operation system

in answer to the question in exchange issue  
wonderpaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of 
what is going on in windows  he suggests linux  

my question is can the current software on my machine 
use linux if i were to switch to that os and if not how 
much software is available for linux  seems all i find is 
for windows and some for the mac  thanks

from  nicetyaolcom
subject  what can i do about my computer freezing issue 

my computer freezes when i use aol and sometimes when
im just using the basic functions of windows  my
defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan
disk never finds anything wrong but there has to be

hello nicety

i  have to agree with jim shofstall httpwwwwonderpaintcom  
when he wrote in exchange issue 

snip
 one major problem is that many programs dont release memory 
when you exit  when working in windoze ive always taken the 
approach of rebooting on a regular basis before ive had problems 
snip

i believe aol is a shell that sits on windows which pretty much 
negates any hope for stability nix is the only nonmac answer 
for reliable computing i am a red hat linux user as everyones 
favourite redmond os obviously requires more smarts than i 
have to make it do anything useful 

if you have to live with it however there is a cool little free 
download called freemem which you can get here
httpwwwmeikelcom

this utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app you 
also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released 
this may not fix your problem but at least windows will be 
running at peak performance all the time and much easier than 
constant rebooting the more you use this os the more of these 
little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to 
search for

comments on site   httpwwwfloridarentalcouk

just finished looking over your site its very flashy and maybe
just a tad overdone i had difficulty finding my way around
your site and couldnt understand its purpose until i had gone
three pages into it maybe it would be a little more useful to
make your front page navigation a little less confusing

the next page tab is right next to one that says bookmark
this page  no information until you mouseover the tab to
tell you you are entering the site i felt a little overwhelmed
with glitz  animated gifs overemphasized words etc and not
enough information on your openning page


i also surprised to see a site for florida rentals with a url
ending with uk  recommendations for this site
 on the home page a persons eyes are drawn first to the
animation and red text on the yellow background missing
the first sentence remove the animation and add more
details to this important introduction instead of using the
click here button just have a text link following directly
after the introduction
 on the second page have all your links the same color
and all your text a different color dont confuse people on
what is a link and what they need to read underlined text
on the internet can often be confused for a link expecially
when it is in the normal blue link color  having the
important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill
 on the rest of the site you have good information but
you dont need the top menu bar when using the framed
menu and the pages are all untitled

i hope you dont think im being too harsh i just know you
want the best site you can have and i think these changes
will make a world of difference  once a person gets into the
site you have the information organized and complete i
even wanted to come and stay


the animations make this site look amateurish from the
beginning  the flashing bookmark this site makes me
want to leave instead of come back  the font comic sans
ms also looks very kiddy  much could be done to improve
this site


i was confused by this site there are four animated gifs on the
first screen and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between
them i read over the paragraph of information but didnt know
where to click i finally figured out the click here button should
have been up by the text and that is where i should go

on the nd page again too many flashing gifs  other than that
the nd page was much easier to find my way around one
suggestion if youre using frames it is unneccessary to have
the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of
the page as was shown on the special offers page

the font style and bright colors made the site look casual and
laid back like a trip to florida should be so that was good
besides the flashing gifs by the time i left i liked this site but
if i hadnt been reviewing it i dont know if i would have gotten
that far


this site is bright and breezy it is very clean easy to read
and navigate logically presented and informationrich
some pages had too many animated images for my own taste
but the pages are happy and cheery tip if you can get a hold
of paintshop pro you can take out the white squares that
form a background for some images
