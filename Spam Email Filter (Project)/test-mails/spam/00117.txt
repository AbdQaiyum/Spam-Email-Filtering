subject  more on the sircam virus 

in exchange issue  jt wrote

its called the sircam virus and when it spreads it sends
an apparently random file from the harddrives of infected
computers along with it any file on your machine could
be copied and sent to hundreds of other users 

i also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
rid of it  luckily i dont open any attachments unless im 
expecting them and then am still very careful  

heres the ways i was told to get rid of the thing

one fix tool

download fixsircamcom and run the file it will scan drive
c and subfolders and runs in dos
httpwwwantiviruscomvinfosecurityfixsircamcom

another trojan fix tool
httpwwwsarccomavcenterfixsirccom
the fix tool will run from your desktop and will automatically 
rid your computer from the sircam trojan and clean up an 
entries from your registry files

after running either fix tool  reboot your system

hope this helps

subject  many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts

from  nicetyaolcom 
subject  what can i do about my computer freezing issue 

my computer freezes when i use aol and sometimes when 
im just using the basic functions of windows  my 
defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan 
disk never finds anything wrong but there has to be 

dear nicety

as regards your problem with windoze freezing and locking 
up your computer im afraid your sol as finding a true solution  
there are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
resulting in a locked machine  one major problem is that many 
programs dont release memory when you exit  when working 
in windoze ive always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
regular basis before ive had problems especially if ive opened 
and closed several different applications

back in august  john kirch a microsoft certified professional
wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a nix operating
system vs windows nt  you can read it at 
httpwwwunixvsntorgkirch  what was true back then is 
even truer today  every current worm you are hearing about 
on the news lately occurs in windoze operating systems 

 so imho the solution to your machine lockingup is to change 
the os  running linux my machine has been up for periods of 
weeks at a time with no need to reboot  in over a year of running 
i can count the lockups on one hand and have fingers left over 
i have more software installed than i ever had in windoze  and 
the price is right  free

i really love clean uncluttered easy to read and navigate 
sites like these two they are both very attractive and well 
presented  in my opinion the book site could have been 
a little softer or with similar characteristics to the next site 
preparing me for the site that it links to and having a 
relationship to it

what i did feel most was that i was expecting something 
related to the url  prosperouswomen to come up as this 
word was what caught my attention and caused me to 
click in the first place

i feel the book page should be a tool for the pw page and 
not a preface to it  the main site should be the pw and the 
book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page
you need to take e out of changing on the book page

with these

find out how you can receive the free book
email us at directionsuaolcom        
and
for this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing 
write to us at directionsuaolcom

i would have liked these to be clickable links rather than 
copy and paste

very nice job on the sites margarete  i really liked them 
and i have ordered the book


i waited over  seconds and had yet to see the first page  
could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics 
or where we were headed


very clear focused site with one page promoting a free book

dont underline text unless its a link or somehow distinguish 
between the links and that which is not

i finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
linked so i checked that out also i think you need to make that 
link more noticeable and also link to your bizland site

if you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
request message to an aol email address you would get more 
requests and also might be able to automate this process


i loved this site because it was clear simple and to the point
it also peaked my curiosity and i followed the link supplied  
if only other sites we so simplistic


with the masterminding site the first sentence major impact 
on your life is incomplete there were also runon sentences 
in the copy even though the copy is quite effective the box 
with life changeing insight needs the e taken out of 
changeing and it looked like the text could have been extended 
to go from side to side in the first paragraph   an amazing  
year old text felt like it should be book or secret instead of 
using the word text  also it would add credibility to say where 
or how or by whom it was discovered

the message is clear the site design simple two things that 
would make the site more effective on getting people to request 
the book would be to say if this is an ebook how long it is in 
what format it is etc and then also using a form for people to 
order instead of emailing you should be able to pick up a form 
for this just about anywhere
