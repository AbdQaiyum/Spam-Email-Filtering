tivo now or never

httprsnettnjspttpysjsneiqjsnwxbwqnphttpaffwwwtvpredictionscomfpredictionshtml
ready for thisbr
br
the next five months could determine whetherbr 
tivo the personal video recorder servicebr
ultimately survives as a businessbr
br
tivo which launched five years ago has less br
than  subscribers the companys stockbr
dipped below three this week and network execsbr
are openly questioning whether the digital recorderbr
which permits skipping commercials with a few br
clicks of the remote will destroy their advertisingbr
models there even have been hints that the br
networks could support a move by the cable br
industry to offer a pvr that does not permitbr
commercial skipping and that pvr would not br
be a tivo br
br
to its credit tivo has been remarkably successful br
at building brand loyalty and awareness tivo br
reports that  percent of its subscribers havebr
recommended the service to a friend and whenbr
people talk about pvrs they say tivo just br
like the way people say coke when they talkbr
about soft drinks br
br
but wall street the media and the industry br
are all growing impatient tivo needs to startbr
putting some big numbers on the board  br
and it needs to do it this holiday season if br
it doesnt stock analysts who have supported tivo br
until now will run for the hills that will pushbr
the companys stock price down even further andbr
if that happens tivo could have just two choicesbr
sell the company under duress or wait until its br
funding dries up br
br
consequently i predict that tivo will launch br
an intensive marketing blitz over the next br
five months right through the holiday seasonbr
the blitz will include a sharp increase in br
retail distribution tv advertising and pr br
efforts the company needs to show wall br
street  and the industry  that it will be br
the brand leader in the pvr category and itbr
needs to show that it can generatebr
mass consumer demand br
br
how does tivo demonstrate thatbr
br
anything short of  subs at years endbr
will have people questioning whether tivo hasbr
the right stuff cable execs who are watchingbr
tivo closely might decide that adding the br
service is not such a great selling point br
after all and echostar which currently doesbr
not have an agreement with tivo may decidebr
to stay with its unbranded pvr service after br
its merger with directv is approved in dc br
tivo currently has a partnership with directvbr
but its unclear what will happen to the deal if br
the merger is approved br
br
so there is much at stake  and its not extremebr
to say that tivos ultimate future could be decidedbr
in the next several months br
br
will it succeed i predict that tivo will achievebr
a partial success the company will boost its br
subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claimbr
as the  pvr service however in time i br
also predict it will decide to sell the companybr
to a large media outfit such as sony or perhapsbr
even liberty media this would give tivo the br
necessary funding and industry connectionsbr
for longterm growth and survivalbr
