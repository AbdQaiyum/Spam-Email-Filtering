dear sir
 
i am mr kenneth uba the manager bills and exchange
at the foreign remittance department of the union bank of nigeria plc 
 
i am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department 
 
we discovered an abandoned sum of  thirty one million united states dollars only in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in november  in a plane crash
 

 
since we heard of his death we have been expecting his nextofkin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the nextofkin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines
unfortunately neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund 
 
upon this discovery i and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund
 
we have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus 
  for you as foreign partner   for us the officials in my department and   for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business
 

upon the successful completion of this transfer i and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share it is from our   we intend to import agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund  

to commence this transaction we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return email and enclose your private contact telephone number fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made

note also this transaction must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature 
 
i look forward to receiving your prompt response
