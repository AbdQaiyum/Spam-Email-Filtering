bquestions bp

from moviebuffcliffhangercom br
subject using pictures as links p

im changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages 
but someone told me i should still put a click here underneath all the 
pictures to me this removes all purpose of using the pictures  p

how can i get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so for example i have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days p

subject unblocking sites so i can access issue  p

 i am currently living in a place where the isp is 
blocking  of 
the web i was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy but i dont know what that means i am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites  br
p
a proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses they can be tricky to setup yourself 
i have had very good results with surfola basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf throughfrom their servers i have several places i surf from that 
block content surfola easily bypasses them its also free you can also make money 
with them but i just use them to bypass anal retentive ispcorporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously p

i have a detailed rightup on them at a hrefhttplinkpakscompaidtosurfsurfolaphp httplinkpakscompaidtosurfsurfolaphp a
see there for more info if anything is not clear feel free to ask 
email  signup links on httplinkpakscompaidtosurfsurfolaphp page p

from wyn publishing  wynpublishinginamecom br
subject using a proxy to visit blocked sites p

from cj  cjpostcom br
subject unblocking sites so i can access issue  p

cj p

two such sites that allows proxy surfing are br
httpwwwanonymisecom and
httpwwwanonymizercom  p

however if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work 
also note that if your isp is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit then it is time to change providers p

i reviewed site  and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
i dont like mustard yellow for a background also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be firstcome not as 
shown on the pagep

i feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site i will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter  p

as has been mentioned many times some information about the person 
doing the page is always good  we need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to br
p

dennis  i took a look at your site and have recommendations 
for improving your pagebr
 i use internet explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
smaller the text you used was quite large like a font used for a heading 
for all the text by making the text size smaller it wouldnt feel like 
you were screaming at me also the background was just too muchbr
 there were spelling errors in the text often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time but have a friend 
look it over spelling errors make the page look unprofessionalbr
 offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe also if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address you must have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribebr
 think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter 
it looks more professional than just offering an email address to send tobr
 offer information about yourself and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the pastbr
 build another page for sponsoring info and put prices on that 
page remove all pricing information from the home pagebr
p

i feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text 
i also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily 
i noticed some spelling errors and i think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided and online payments should be accepted 
a site that sells advertising should have advertisments on itbr
p

this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message  i did not like the background colour however that is 
personal it did not detract from the information  i was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue there was an error in the wording a word 
missed which needs correction and i think the fonts could be 
smaller overall a nonconfusing site which makes a nice change cheersbr

p

could use a better background and the fonts are very large there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs  
first comfirst serve and to place a sponsor advertisement 
send your to my emailbr
p

a single page site it is necessary to subscribe to the webmasters 
newsletter to see what hes doing and it doesnt seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit i wouldnt for example he claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that he says we probably 
didnt know and this is possible but in my opinion he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see  when the appetite so to speak if he want people to 
subscribe as it is i would not botherbr
p

what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net but what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner whose email reads damorgarjryahoocom 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free line ad 
he also tells of paid category of advertisements this is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about to 
points size which gets difficult to read br
p

a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes there is only really one problem with this page  its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter no scratch that its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter a bold enough 
move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so i didnt even subscribe presumably 
youd want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself perhaps a sample issue 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads p
