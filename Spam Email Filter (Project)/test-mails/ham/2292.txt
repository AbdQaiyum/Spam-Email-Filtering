the tmobile sidekick  the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
danger hiptop pdaphone  is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear as soon as im in san francisco for more than a couple days straight i 
really think im going to pick this up 

    thats partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors   compared with  and up for the others in the same 
    spirit tmobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new relatively 
    high speed gprs network for  per month  far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wirelessdata plans voice 
    time is another story  more on that later 

    another reason i like the sidekicks prospects it was designed for and 
    will be pitched to a very different market while vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on enterprise customers  the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing even though most 
    clearly dont at this point  danger and tmobile are targeting in their 
    own words internetsavvy primarily urban young adults in the  to 
    yearold demographic 

i am that demographic link discuss thanks steve
