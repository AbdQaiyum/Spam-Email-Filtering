 check it into the spambayes project  sfs disks are cheap wink

perhaps more useful would be if tim could check in the pickles
generated by one of his training runs so that others can see how
tims training data performs against their own corpora  this could
also be the starting point for a selfcontained distribution youve
got to start with something and training with pythonlist data
seems just as good as anything else
