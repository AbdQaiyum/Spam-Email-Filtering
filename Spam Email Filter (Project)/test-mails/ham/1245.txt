    just cvs uped and nowadays catchup unseen is extremely slow on 
    large  msgs unseen sequences anybody else having this problem
   
   ill take the blame
   
   the reason i suspect is that were needlessly reading the sequences file 
   multiple times because of other sequences  i need to make the code much 
   smarter about handling that file but first i have a few other fish to fry in 
   my rather large patch thats on its way
   
  
  no panic
  
  im all for cleaning things up before getting it optimized
 
 okay this fix is now checked in
 
im afraid it didnt help it still seems to be slower than  month 
ago maybe slightly faster than yeasterday im still seeing an 
unseen countdown in the log
