  would someone please enlighten me on dependencies  prerequisites
  for installation in freebsd the official documentation isnt
particularly
  explicit about this stuff  eg procmail is mentioned but without
saying
  whether or not its essential  no info provided on whether gnumake is
  required or if standard bsd make is ok

 i thought we were quite good about it in the readme file

 procmail is essential if youre using a spamassassin for local
 delivery b not using a milter and c not using a mailaudit
 script instead  so probably yes

 bsd make is ok if perl generally uses it to build perl modules
 spamassassin is just anotehr perl module in that respect

back to this stuff again   searched high  low but definitely nothing
on this system even vaguely resembling a readme file for spamassassin
i have procmail installed but having major problems comprehending the
setup  would appreciate info on any simple english howto
