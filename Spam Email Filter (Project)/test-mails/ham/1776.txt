    i dont know how big that pickle would be maybe loading it each time
    is fine  or maybe marshalling
 
 my tests train on about  msgs and a binary pickle of the database is
 approaching  million bytes

my paltry message training set makes a mb where mbe bytes
pickle  hammiepy which i just checked in will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file  with that same message base the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty mb  it also takes longer to write

  using a database
   real    ms
   user    ms
   sys     ms

  using a pickle
   real    ms
   user    ms
   sys     ms

this is on a piii at mhz i dont know what its supposed to
be  is what proccpuinfo says

for comparison spamoracle currently the gold standard in my mind at
least for speed on the same data blazes along

   real    ms
   user    ms
   sys     ms

its data file which appears to be a marshalled hash is kb
however its compiled ocaml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer ocamllex so well never be
able to outperform it  its something to keep in mind though

i dont have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages  actually i
do and the database blows the pickle out of the water but it scores
every word with  so im not sure thats a fair test   in any
case mb per user is probably too large and mb is questionable  

on the other hand my pickle compressed very well with gzip shrinking
down to mb
