gab i thought this nekkid url was going to be about the
gab infringement of st amendment rights for broadcasters
gab and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
gab from making money on advertisements that are deemed
gab thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
gab government board  as it was posted to discussion i
gab thought thered be some

gab instead its a postgazette column by brian oneill
gab lamenting the fact that some people know how to
gab fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
gab of their right to peaceable assembly  obviously
gab hes poking fun at the idea that specific groups
gab get specific zones and that its not up to the
gab police to decide what messages and signs get put into
gab what zones to most expediently keep order  

oh thats right greg  because was explicitly clear that the probush
folks went out and did the permit dance   so where in the article is
this again

lets get something straight here   this is a first amendment issue
public streets provided one isnt blocking traffic generally tend to
be sorta ok at least from my last interpretation of con law a few
years ago ill feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed and the specific facts in this case are weak    if this guy
was merely holding a sign which it seems was the case for all the
probush folks he did nothing wrong  he certainly didnt do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge

ill play with your perspective though   lets assume a few things
if i walk into the city office and tell them i want to peacably
assemble against bush do you think theyll give me a permit
probably not   so i lie   then the cop does what happened in this
scenario  he walks up checks my permit and finds out that i
falsified my statement to get this said document   he arrests me
end of story

gab the problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
gab nowadays that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
gab political rallies that you dont agree with has become
gab common practice  the courts have constantly ruled
gab that there are some restrictions on the first amendment
gab they teach you that your very first year of law school

ill agree with owen on this one  muddied my ass  how hard is it to
chose between a republocrat or a demipublican   not very  shouting
down has grown to become the answer because the government over a
span of years and with the help of the courts has limited the
rights we have as citizens under the first amendment    if you
question the policy about terrorism or drugs or iraq or bush in
general youre aiding terrorism   if you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy g conferences youre an
anarchist and youre herded off to a designated protest spot miles
away from anything   part of the point of speech is to be heard
i can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere and while thats
speech its not effective speech  people are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way




gab i think that given the information as laid out by the story
gab mr oneill has confused free speech with action  free
gab speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
gab every american seems to involve the ability to communicate
gab an idea to an unknown audience  action involves directing
gab a specific comment to a specific welldefined individual or audience
gab that has immediate harmful and sometimes physical 
gab effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person 

getting back to my original point  how do you communicate  an idea to
an unknown audience if youre miles from where the audience is   how
do you bypass the rules for being miles away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime  i dont think mr nell was
throwing pies at bush  a sign the last time i checked didnt cause
physical injury or even emotional harm  if i remember cohen v
california  us   its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist but the individual listening who has
the option to leave


just my  while its still considered legal
