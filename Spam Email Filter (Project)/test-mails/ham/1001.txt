the nature of our patent is about putting a warrant mark in rfc 
xheaders or in the body to allow senders to warrant their mail as
notspam and then to use copyright and trademark infringement to
enable habeas to enforce that warranty

why is it that i envision verisign doing something like this  yeah 
like i want verisign to sign all my spam er mail for me  pay them 
enough and theyd probably sign spam too
