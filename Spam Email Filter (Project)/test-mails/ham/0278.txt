washingtonthe canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies

a discussion draft httpwwwcanadajusticegccaenconslaal 
released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
canadian with an internet account a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online

the canadian government including the department of justice 
httpcanadajusticegcca and industry canada 
httpwwwicgcca wrote the page blueprint as a nearfinal step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in 
early 

arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form 
canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even runofthemill crimes they also claim that by enacting 
these proposals canada will be following its obligations under the 
council of europes cybercrime treaty 
httpnewscomcomhtml which the country is in the 
process of considering

if the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses authorize police to order internet 
providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden 
electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in 
most circumstances a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct internet monitoring

canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of 
europe and representatives from both countries police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
httpconventionscoeinttreatyencadrelistetraiteshtm which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups 
of nearly  participating nations only albania has formally adopted 
httpconventionscoeinttreatyensearchsigaspntcmdf 
or ratified the treaty

michael geist httpaixuottawacaegeist a professor at the 
university of ottawa who specializes in ecommerce law says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems 
weak

it seems to me that the main justification theyve given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes geist said to me thats not a particularly convincing 
argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority 
make that case

geist added that theres nothing in the document that indicates new 
powers are needed i dont know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems

probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention 
orders the united states has a similar requirement called the 
communications assistance for law enforcement act 
httpwwwepicorgprivacywiretapcaleacalealawhtml but it 
applies only to preinternet telecommunications companies

it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and 
internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies according to the proposal companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment

sarah andrews an analyst at the electronic privacy information center 
httpwwwepicorg epic who specializes in international law says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not 
just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data epic opposes 
httpwwwprivacyinternationalorgissuescybercrimecoengoletterhtm 
the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights

another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs 
of police recommends the establishment of a national database with 
personal information about all canadian internet users the 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information 
the draft says

gus hosein a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an 
activist with privacy international calls the database a dumb idea

immediately you have to wonder if youre allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether youre allowed to connect to the internet 
anonymously hosein said

a representative for george radwanski 
httpwwwprivcomgccaaueasp canadas privacy commissioner said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not have any comments on 
the paper as it stands

comments on the proposal can be sent to laaljusticegcca 
mailtolaaljusticegcca no later than nov
