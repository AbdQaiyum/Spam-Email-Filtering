 dont worry about the warnings to fix the error edit spamcc and right

   thanks for posting this tip  i had the same problem compiling with
tru and that took care of it

   when i did the make install i got this error

lock  f etcmailspamassassinlocalcf
  cp ruleslocalcf etcmailspamassassinlocalcf
sh syntax error at line   unexpected
 exit 
stop

   it appears that this comes from the instcfs part of the makefile
which copies localcf into etcmailspamassassin  the makefile has
brackets around the f test but they dont show up above  any ideas
