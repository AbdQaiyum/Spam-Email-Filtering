decss detractors have repeatedly claimed that decss needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of dvds possible recently in private email 
ernest miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the dmca in this 
indepth special report i show that using perfectly legal i assume 
licensed offtheshelf consumer software copying dvds is easy and in many 
ways encouraged 

tools
 powerbook g with slotloading dvd drive any model should work
 monsters inc collectors edition dvd any dvd should work
 copy of mac os x  jaguar 

process
 insert dvd into drive notice how jaguar helpfully loads the dvd player for 
you
 open the dvd it appears on the desktop and drag the videots folder to 
your hard drive ejct the dvd
 in dvd player select open videots folder from the file menu use the 
dialog that appears to select the videots folder on your hard drive 

now the dvd plays just like it would were the dvd in the drive by extension i 
could also put the dvd up on my site for you to download and watch i could 
share it via a pp network and i havent done anything to decrypt the dvd or 
violate the dmca ive used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my i assume fullylicensed consumer laptop 

disclaimer seth schoen whose opinion i highly respect on these matters 
finds it unlikely that the dvd was cssencrypted if this was possible i am not 
sure how to verify if the dvd is cssencrypted if someone has a suggestion 
please let me know however if it is true then its very interesting that 
disney has released such a major movie without encryption
