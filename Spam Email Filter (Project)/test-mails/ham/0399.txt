 has anyone figured out whats up with this  does someone out there
 think that fork needs some mime tutoring

i was puzzled at first but i think i understand what happened

first i approved the post because it didnt appear to be spam even
though it wasnt from a member  i thought it was odd that someone
wanted to send the mime blurb to the list but it was not really that
different from causing the new york times web site to send a story to
the list  except that the bits here are antediluvian but old bits are
a problem to be solved by social opporobrium not technical constraints

but i think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by
klez and had both fork and the pinerobot autoresponder address in their
mailbox or addressbook so klez forged mail from forkxentcom to the
autoresponder which responded  to fork
