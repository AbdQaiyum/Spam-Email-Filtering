 i am wondering whether theres a way that i can use sitescooper andor plucker
 or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
 more palmos friendly

	you could try antiword httpwwwwinfielddemonnllinux
its consoled based and converts word  docs to text and some images to
postscript and png  you could also try openoffice andor abiword if you
have x installed

 i dont have a windows machine so it becomes problematic to convert them
 i know that if this were not the case in word i could save them as some
 other more friendly format

	great
