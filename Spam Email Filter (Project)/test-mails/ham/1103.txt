hi folks

ive been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a form mycomps without going through
the editor but so far havent got the right recipe

i currently have in my exmhdefaults

mopsspamtext        spam
mopsspamcommand     msgforward form spamcomps noedit nowhatnowproc  msg
remove


ive also tried with seditsend draft t  after the forward command
it should forward to a spam address where filters get adjusted and then
delete  it does so but not without producing the edit window

any help appreciated
