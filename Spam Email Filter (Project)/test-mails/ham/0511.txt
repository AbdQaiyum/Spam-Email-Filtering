 if guys still have silly antequated ideas about womens role then
 their opportunities for finding women will be scarce  

what is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in

i dont have statistics on the love half life but it seems longterm 
relationships use something else for glue

clearly our nonsilly nonantiquated ideas about relationships have
resulted in mostly shortduration relationships and singleparented
dysfunctional kids not enough of them too boot so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over were importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas

at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
something wrong

maybe we should really go dirty tleilaxu all the way
