 yes confirming what i said in my last message ah i see where the problem
 lies you seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that zimbabwe and
 zambia are the same country

no that would be rather silly there are conflicting reports on whether
zambia is prepared to accept milled gm grain or not  and from reports from
various sources considerable debate within that country theres complex
issues not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists which was my original point
