  if i can use apt can i use it to get updates from these  different
  places
   the null update redhat upgrades
   the null files at freshrpmsnet
   the regular rh files from freshrpmsnet
 you could build your own aptrepository just mirror the needed
 directories eg by using a wget cron job symlink the needed rpms
 and recreate the repository it is already worth the trouble if you
 have more than one installation

always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides rh things like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different configure options you can get srcrpm edit spec bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild insert
into apt and let loose 

doesnt freshrpms have updates dir too maybe not quite as up to date as
update but still i would never use update there is another
repository at aptrpmtuxfamilyorg iirc not sure if that had the
updates
