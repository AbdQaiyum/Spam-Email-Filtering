  done  i also eliminated the msgs variable on the theory that simpler is
  
  better i spent a lot of time hacking out the underbrush in exmh while 
  working on the sequences window

just a big thank you to chris for being willing to dive in and get
very messy  the sequence management code is some of the very oldest
in exmh and surely suffered as features were added over several years
when this stabilizes it will be a great excuse for a  release
