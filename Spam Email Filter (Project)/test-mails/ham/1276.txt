 i wanted to find out who tried recompiling a working apt rpm for null
 or psyche  i would like to get good gstreamer packages done by monday
 when its released

i have a working apt cnc package for red hat linux  it will be
available at the same second the distribution will and so will a complete
apt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for red
hat linux 

i didnt want to say all this before monday but as the new release already
leaked from many places and official statements made about it it
shouldnt be a big deal 

ill keep you all posted on monday theyll even be a big aptrelated
surprise
