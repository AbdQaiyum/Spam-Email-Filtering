brothel duty for australian mp

a conservative member of parliament in australia is set to 
spend the day as a slave at one of western australias most 
notorious brothels 

liberal party member barry haase was won in a charity auction 
after the madam of langtrees brothel in the mining town of 
kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day 



i hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
have been able to make before ms kenworthy said 

mr haase a member of prime minister john howards party 
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel 

you cant be halfhearted about fundraising for significant 
charities and i think im big enough to play the game he said
