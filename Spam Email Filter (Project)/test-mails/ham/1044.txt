 lately ive got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower i 
 just decided to check that vs reality and yes speed has left the 
 scene somewhere between the release of  and now
 
 i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder  
 msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably
 
 release  msec
 latest cvs  msec
 
 frankly i think this is getting close to nonacceptable since the 
 user settings hasnt changed
 
 anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared

heres a fix that i think will make a real difference

ftocshowsequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids 
to update and if its called that way it only removes or adds tags for those 
messages  then in places like msgchange we only update the messages which have
changed

also a separate ftocshowsequence function which only updates the display of 
one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids  
in a place like msgchange it would only need to update the cur sequence

if nobody else gets to it ill do this when i get back
