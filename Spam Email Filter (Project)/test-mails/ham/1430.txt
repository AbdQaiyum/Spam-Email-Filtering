jmjmasonorg justin mason writes

 sounds a lot like tmda to me  filing date is july  
 granted may  

 tmdaers have you seen this before

no but thanks for pointing it out

 id presume tmda is prior art but still it could be troublesome

yup  tmdas core functionality was fully established before even the
filing date

anyone with experience in this area have a recommendation on whether
this should be pursued or not
