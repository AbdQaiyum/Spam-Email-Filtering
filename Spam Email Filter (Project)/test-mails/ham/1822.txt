 these results are from timtestpy  ive got three sets of spam and ham
 with about  messages in each set  heres what happens when i enable
 my latest received header code

if youve still got the summary files please cvs up and try running cmppy
again  in the process of generalizing cmppy you managed to make it skip
half the lines wink  that is if youve got n sets you should get
nn pairs for each error rate  you have  sets so you should get 
pairs of fn rates and  pairs of fp rates

     false positive percentages
             tied
             won    
             won    

     won    times
     tied   times
     lost   times

     total unique fp went from  to 

     false negative percentages
             won    
             won    
             lost   

     won    times
     tied   times
     lost   times

     total unique fn went from  to 

looks promising  getting  lines of output for each block would give a
clearer picture of course

 anthonys header counting code does not seem to help

it helps my test data too much winksigh
