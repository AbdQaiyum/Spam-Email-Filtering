claim   president george w bush proclaimed the problem with
the french is that they dont have a word for entrepreneur

status   false

status crap


lloyd grove of the washington post was unable to reach baroness
williams to gain her confirmation of the tale but he did
receive a call from alastair campbell blairs director of
communications and strategy i can tell you that the prime
minister never heard george bush say that and he certainly
never told shirley williams that president bush did say it
campbell told the post if she put this in a speech it must
have been a joke

so some guy failed to reach the source but instead got spin doctor to
deny it  wot is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that yes blair is going around casting aspersions on bush

its an amusing anecdote i dont know if its true or not but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion status false
