 i use a mostly red hat  system but prefer to configure and build my 
 kernel by hand  id like to humbly offer a tweak to alsadriverspec 
 that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances  i recognize that 
 freshrpmsnet packages are designed with standard red hat in mind 
 including a standard kernel rpm  however i hope that matthias will 
 consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation

well i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
against something that wasnt installed through rpm 

what id recommend in your case  you should keep at least one original red
hat linux kernel you do just in case right  and install the matching
alsakernel package as youll need at least one because of the
dependencies then for your custom built kernel simply configure
withcardsall  make  make install destdirtmpalsadriver from the
alsadriver sources then as root copy all the modules under
tmpalsadriverlibmodules to your modules dir and run depmod a

of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all unneeded
drivers as i guess thats one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel

i find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem its
what ive done and what ill keep doing on my laptop where im running a
kernel recompiled with acpi
