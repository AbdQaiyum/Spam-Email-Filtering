hmm  im ccing the exmhworkers list because i really dont know
much about the various pgp interfaces  i think there has been some
talk about issues with the latest version of gpg

  linux habitrailhomefoolserrantcom smp  smp thu sep

  its not clear to me this is a bug with exmh per se but its something 
that
      
  manifests through exmh so i figured asking you might help me track it 
down
  
  when i receive a gpg encrypted message and it asks me for a passphrase 
it
  first tries to ask me via the tty under which exmh is running it tells 
me m
     y 
  passphrase is incorrect every time at which point exmh offers me the 
line i
     n 
  the message about decrypting i click the line and it offers me the 
dialog
  box and tells me the passphrase is correct and shows me the decrypted 
  message
  
  any ideas on that
