   interestingi dont think this was my bug
   it appears that msgchange was asked to change to message 

something like that is quite possible but perviously typing nonsense
in didnt cause tracebacks and now it does and the traceback came
from the sequence code

perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status
line complaining about my lousy typing   thats probably what it
should keep on doing the red part isnt important obviously
