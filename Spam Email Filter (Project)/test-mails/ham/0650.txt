 to make what work  i already pointed out that a single drive is
 comparable between idescsi

alas thats wrong both the drives are faster  krpm vs  krpm
faster seek and the eide protocol is ridiculously dumb queing
disconnect
 
 i think youre wrong with recent releases  ill check this week 
 theres also jfs and xfs

none of them are production quality right now only ext and ext qualify  
it will take a good while a year or two before we can trust anything
else
 
 scsi has got advantages still particular if it comes to offshelf 
 highdensity racks
 
 check out raidzonecom

have you looked inside a dualcpu u dell three drives are easy to get 
in anything else would require a redesign and would in nontrivial 
thermal engineering issues
 
 a number of vendors are putting the promise ide hardware on the
 motherboard  all that remains is the proper drive socket

i cant think of a single major vendor who sells u systems with hardware
eide raid

 additionally you can get hardware ide raid as a pair of drive bays or
 even an ideidex controller that can be screwed into a u chassis

i believe you that stuff can be found if one is looking for it however 
i wouldnt put this into production unless ive had that system hanging in 
the local rack under simulated load for a half a year
