    right click on the folder label in the folder list

that the way i have it configured and it sounds as if the way tony does
too just does a move rather than select as target without moving

of course if you can manage to get no messages currently selected then
it works fine

    in the main window the  key puts you into a change 
      folder mode the first time you use it after starting exmh
      hit a second  and you go to set a target mode  type a few
      characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete

this works but is not nice if youre not using the keyboard but just
the mouse

tony i agree  a nice way to link in one click would be good and should
be easy to add though currently adding mouse bindings something like
shift right click would be a good choice is much harder than adding
key bindings

but note theres no need to undo  the way i generally use link if
the desired destination folder isnt the current selected target is
to right click on the target which selects it and moves the message
and because i have the automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set select the message again and then link

exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time that is one of delete move or link   selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three so you cannot
achieve a move by doing a link then delete then commit it needs to
be link commit delete commit  xmh was just the same there incidentally

   hows spring shaping up down under

no meaningful comment from me im not there at the minute   but im told
that where im from it is cold wet and miserable though has been better
during the day sunny days cold nights for the past few    in any case
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away
