  btw i think ill kake it so that my ogle package automatically inserts
  this options idecd dma to etcmodulesconf it currently creates
  thedevdvd link to devcdrom which will work most of the time if
  theres only one drive if no devdvd exists
 
 eek  maybe its just me but i dont think thats a good idea 
 outputting a message in post and providing a readme of some kind would
 be better as well as perhaps adding a note in description

why eek 
if no devdvd exists itll create it
if devdvd exists it wont touch it
if someone installs ogle a dvd player im assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a dvdrom all
of them support dma but since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change im still hesitating to integrate it 

my goal is to allow users to install a dvd player through synaptic and play
dvds in no time outputting a message in the post section of a package is
always a bad idea putting the tip in the description sounds good though
