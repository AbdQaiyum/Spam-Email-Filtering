    danq i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less
    danq aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path
    danq into everyones inbox and after weve seen evidence that the
    danq system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score

better yet let the ga figure out the correct score  that will obviously
take awhile since youll have to acquire enough messages with it but it
should give you a good idea if the presence of habeus headers are good spam
indicators or not  if they are my guess is that habeus will probably not
succeed

taking things further offtopic does habeus charge a license fee to
organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole
revenue stream to come from legal judgements  on the one hand if they
charge license fees id worry that when times got tough theyd be somewhat
less critical of organizations wed call spammers today in order to generate
license fees  if not id worry the pendulum would swing the other way and
theyd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more
revenues from judgements andor out of court settlements  either way it
seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk
