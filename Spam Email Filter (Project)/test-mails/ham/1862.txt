 hmmm   how about you create empty datahamset stuff all your
 files into a datahamreservoir folder then run the rebalpy script to
 randomly parcel messages out to the various real directories

im afraid rebal is quadratictime in the  of msgs it shuffles around 
since it was only intended to move a few files around its dead simple

an easy thing is to start the same way  move all the files into a single
directory  then do randomshuffle on an oslistdir of that directory
then its trivial to split the result into n slices and move the files into
n other directories accordingly

 i suspect you can pull the same stunt for your dataspam stuff

yup
