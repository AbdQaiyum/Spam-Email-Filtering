i would appreciate it if you could get gabber packages for red hat  i 
will be making a new release soon but even in the meantime  
packages would be ok

i know that in the beta red hat was using a modified version of 
gnomelibs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm if this is 
still the case in  i can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work 
again

 hi all

 all freshrpmsnet is now set for the imminent release of red hat linux 
 
 the whole release process is a lot less secret as usual since there 
 have
 been some leaks including a mirror purposely wide open 

 see this article about the release and the leaks 
 httpnewscomcomhtmltagfdtop

 as its no secret anymore the files will be available today morning 
 for
 you americans afternoon for us europeans and to go with them there 
 are
 already quite a few freshrpmsnet packages ready

 mirror list for download theyre not open yet 
 httpfreshrpmsnetmirrorspsychehtml

 new freshrpmsnet package list 
 httppsychefreshrpmsnet

 of course apt is also available now version  and fully 
 tested if
 you like apt for your desktop machines i also recommend checking out 
 the
 new synaptic package as it has now been ported to gtk and blends
 perfectly into the distribution

 ill probably post to the list once i open up ftpfreshrpmsnet so you 
 can
 be the first ones to get in and download although i doubt youll have
 trouble finding access to at least one fast mirror using my mirror 
 list

 have fun with psyche
