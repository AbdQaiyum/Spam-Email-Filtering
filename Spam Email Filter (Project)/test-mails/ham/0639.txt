as ive had to resubscribe to fork and forknoarchive
i guess i have to reintroduce myself  im formerly
known as gbolcer at endtech dot com to the fork
mailman program formerly an overposter and love
soaking up bits through avid reading or scanning
of almost every single list thats got informative to say 

hopefully all those overpost will get cleared out at
somepoint and forkarchived
