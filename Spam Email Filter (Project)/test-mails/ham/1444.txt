i may be dense but why would anyone want to utilize habeus  to me it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyones defenses against spam

if i were a spammer id simply set up a server send out my spam with the 
habeus headers and continue till i was reasonably certain id been reported  
then id simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different ip  as 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to im home free

since i can set up spamassassin to i dont lose any email what do i gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through
