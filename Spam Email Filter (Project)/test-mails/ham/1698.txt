 are there any suggestions for fixing this in razoragents razoragents
 could write to syslog by default but i am not sure if that would be
 desirable default behaviour

hi vipul

i reckon if the unwritable log file error condition could be caught by
razor and handled gracefully logging to syslog or devnull itd be a
great help

as it stands if the log file is unwritable the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef unblessed reference  die
error in perl
