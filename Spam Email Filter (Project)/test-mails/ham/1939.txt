great article on a group of east bay activists who rehab junk computers using 
semiskilled volunteers who train other semiskilled volunteers the resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use 

    for the amazonian villages where theres no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities many cities already have commercial internet cafes but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use henshawplath says which is about a 
    days wage for most of the population 

    the imc activists plan to ship off these computers to guayaquil ecuadors 
    main port city by the end of september because none of the computers are 
    being sold in ecuador and because theyre being transferred from an 
    american nonprofit to an ecuadorian one the activists wont be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers its what you call real 
    free trade says eddie nix
