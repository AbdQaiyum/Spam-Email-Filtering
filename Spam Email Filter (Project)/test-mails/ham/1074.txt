 ahh  at work we fire people who use outlook literally true they
 get escorted to the door their badge confiscated and told to return
 the next day to collect their office contents

 why  what threat does outlook pose to your organization

it places the company corporate network and data at risk

outlook is subject to an absurdly large number of exploits with more
being regularly found  an exploited system to whatever extent places
other corporate systems at risk customer systems at risk company
reputation and liability with customers at risk and
proprietarycorporate data at risk  further users cannot be reliably
expected to use outlook in a safe manner  the net result is that
outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned

 have you looked into using a custom sequences file

 more detail please  i do use sequences so im familiar with their
 use but how can i make indices with them and how can i keep them up
 to date

i dont use custom sequences so i cant comment well  i suspect that
youd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences

 the only thing i actually miss in that regard is support for smime

 youre probably running exmh on a local machine  im running it on a
 very remote machine  in this scenario the mime handling is weak

nope  i run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops gratis
ssh x forwarding  in fact your message was read and replied to
this message while at work using an exmh instance running on my home
machine
