xdegrees was at the webdav interoperability testing event last year so
there may be some dav under the hood there someplace

 subject re microsoft buys xdegress  more of a ppdistributed data
 thing


 mr fork writes
  files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
  internet as with napster or freenet in fact the caching in
 xdegrees is
  more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high
 bandwidth
  connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several
  cached locations simultaneously the xdegrees software then reassembles
  these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures
 to verify that
  the downloaded file is the same as the original a key component of this
  digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as
 an http header
  for the file

 this more sophisticated than napster or freenet part seems
 to be the same behavior implemented in many other pp cdns
 such as

    kazaa
    edonkeyovernet
    bittorrent
    gnutella with huge extensions
    onionnetworks webraid

 though the quality of the digest used by each system varies
 wildly
