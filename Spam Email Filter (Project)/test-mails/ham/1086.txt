gotta wonder what the gpg config stuff in exmhexmhdefaults looks 
like  also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending 
message are saying to nmhexmh  my setup works perfectly  that is 
i get a popup window to enter my passphrase into and when i type it 
correctly the message display changes from a prompt to click to 
decrypt to the message content

hmm  im ccing the exmhworkers list because i really dont know
much about the various pgp interfaces  i think there has been some
talk about issues with the latest version of gpg

  its not clear to me this is a bug with exmh per se but its
  something that manifests through exmh so i figured asking you
  might help me track it down
 
  when i receive a gpg encrypted message and it asks me for a
  passphrase it first tries to ask me via the tty under which
  exmh is running it tells me my passphrase is incorrect every
  time at which point exmh offers me the line in the message
  about decrypting i click the line and it offers me the dialog
  box and tells me the passphrase is correct and shows me the
  decrypted message
  
  any ideas on that
