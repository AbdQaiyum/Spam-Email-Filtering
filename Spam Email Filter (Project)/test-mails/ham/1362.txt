 all of these af are related to avifile support 
 normally my fr build of transcode defaults to not use avifile
 but you can use with avifile to force recompiling against it
 
 do you have an old avifile installed maybe
 can you check the configure  line run at the beginning of the
 rebuild process to see if it does include the withoutavifile option
 
yes it was there
you guessed the problem correctly in an earlier email there was still
remnants remaining from an old failed avifile installation
the transcode srcrpm now builds perfectly
thank you very much
you are good
