  tony i cant even mark text in an exmh message window and then
  tony paste it into a terminal window the cut buffer seems to
  tony be completely empty and its previous contents are no
  tony longer there either

brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the x
models of copy and paste  not in those words but that
was how i read it 

i have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a vnc link from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa  as long as i stick to apps being normally 
displayed on my x server i dont have much of a problem

my recollection from my x programming days is that the x model
like everything in x is more complex than the human brain can
handle  it also is very different from the mswindows model
and i get the feeling that tk tries to unify those two models
and fails  not sure what the exmhspecific contribution to the 
confusion is frankly
