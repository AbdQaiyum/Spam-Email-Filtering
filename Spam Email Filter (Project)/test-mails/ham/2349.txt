date t

so i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a 
tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be 
honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind 
that i dont want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the 
tilde 

every commandlineloving geek will tell you that  stands for home 
directory and cd  will take you to your home directory cd username 
will take you to someone elses except on mac os x where it will take you to 
their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can 
trace the presentday practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal 
pages since one single systemwide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more 
commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their publichtml 
subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to httplocalhostusername youre actually being served files 
from that users sites directory within their home directory 

but i dont want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde 

as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela is the expert in 
this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass a word which google 
old habits die hard feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene 
wallingford which like jukkas home page can not be referenced without a 
tilde 

in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in urls a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a 
tilde in its url 

clearly the tilde is underappreciated 

digging further we find this post of jukkas from  in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd 
character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe 
to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter 
the tilde was the tilde so that spanishtyping types could type the ntilde 
now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along 
the line it morphed into a generalpurpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses 

digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
 then an alternate for  and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later jukka confirms this and adds a timeline  for   for  
 for overline then june   the watershed moment in an x committee 
meeting when it was proposed as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease 
share i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or 
what this committee meeting was about the next reference isnt until  
when the tilde was officially added to iso 

and now down the rabbit hole we go scouring usenet which the kids of 
yesterday called deja news and kids today call google 
groups we find a reprint of a  william safire yes that william 
safire article on language in which we learn that  is officially 
pronounced squiggle this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary
 to this very day im not sure this is useful but i just thought it was 
cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ascii characters 

as early as august  tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
 

in july  kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde 

in february  an editors note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde 

as early as january  less used the tilde to denote lines past eof 

as early as july  troff supported the tilde 

in november  a modsources post refers to bourne shell enhancements 
historytildejob control 

as early as january  tilde was included on the dec keyboard and listed 
in the apl character set 

in april  tilde was causing bugs in vi actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh 

in december   is officially pronounced tilde prompting 
this typographical pun 

and thats the earliest reference i can find 

so where does that leave us unsatisfied no doubt there is history here but 
there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in  how did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the s when did it become a synonym for 
home directory when did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites i dont know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research a failing for which i apologize profusely goodnight goodnight 
may you dream of tildes stars and whorls
