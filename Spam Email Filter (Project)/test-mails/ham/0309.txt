 additional comments from alanrdropcom    
i havent tried  yet because it requires filespec which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it  i havent filed a bug yet because i suspect its
because im still running  perl because of reported compatibility issues
with  and later but i probably will because i think theres too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems and spamassassin didnt
at least in the quickest of looks say it needed a newer one  the perl  stuff
was bad enough  but this is all a separate soapbox
