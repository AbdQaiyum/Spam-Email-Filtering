oops  turns out i wasnt careful installing it so the exmhlibrary
variable was pointing at my old installation  im surprised it worked
as well as it did

in any case i removed the old library directory and edited exmh
exmhbg exmhstrip etc to point at the right one  now im getting
another traceback on startup

cant read mhprivpubseqfamilycur no such variable
    while executing
mhseq folder seq add mhprivpubseqfolderseq mhseqexpand
folder msgids
    procedure mhreadseqs line 
    invoked from within
mhreadseqs folder seqs
    procedure mhsequences line

folderchange exmhfolder
    procedure exmh line 
    invoked from within
exmh
    after script


family is the folder i was in when i quit exmh

im on a remote display right now and its really slow  ill have to
play with it more tonight when i get home to see if there are any
other problems

  i just updated to the latest cvs  i had been running a build from june  
  hitting the flist button gives the following traceback

  it seems to only happen in a folder with no unseen messages
  
  chris is this related to your recent changes
 
 curious  i changed the arguments to ftocshowsequences to drop the folder 
 argument and instead have an optional msgids argument  somehow your version 
 of scanfolder is still trying to pass f  you seem to have the latest 
 ftoctcl  but not the latest scantcl 
 
 i dont know how that happened but try getting your source tree completely 
 up to date
