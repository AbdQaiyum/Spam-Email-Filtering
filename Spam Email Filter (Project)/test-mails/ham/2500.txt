on planes the case is so little it can fit in my suit case i missed a great 
photo opportunity when i was in the airport a couple of weeks ago and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle it was in a huge plastic darth vader 
shipping case the buckles on the thing were about the size of my uke i 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass sidebyside anyway heres 
a standup bass that looks much more portable the kona walkingstick you still 
need to carry around an amp though link discuss thanks prentiss
