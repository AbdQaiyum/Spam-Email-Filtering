misc rants about finding jobs java vs c what makes a good programmer etc
snip

okay hmm i thought twice about this but what the hey jobs are hard to
come by theres a company hiring in mountain view looking for a few good
hackers no java no gui not even c  just c and linux and networking
and good old stuff like that they just raised a wad of money and theyre
looking for a few really good programmers says the cto i know him 
very smart guy drives too fast though for what thats worth

joe bob says check it out id be happy to pass on your resume or you can
send it straight to them probably wont matter if i pass it on since i
dont know you guys anyway

   forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job
  
   i was talking about the open reqs at kana the company i 
 work for
    oh but programming in java is beneath you
  
   nope just lacking years and years of it for some silly 
 reason people
   always want things to be reliable fast and 
 crossplatform so all my
   employers have forced me to code in c 
 
 c is more reliable than java
 
 as for crossplatform c exists on more platforms but a java program
 is much easier to move from one platform to another so im not sure
 what you mean
 
 im not trying to fight a language war but im puzzled by the depth
 of your antijava hatred
 
   i know lots of high school
   kiddies with plenty of java tho not having to teach people about
   pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the 
 coder boot
   time ill send them your way when they graduate
 
 pointers so a language has to have pointers to be real and 
 references
 dont count i gather whats so great about pointers why do you
 miss them if your doing embedded stuff fine yes you need the
 performance and control over memory that c provides probably
 but if your implementing tier n of a tier n system and pounding
 against a database then java is often a very reasonable choice
 especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory
 
 optimization who says you cant optimize java i can and have
 and there are good tools that allow you to do it i use optimizeit
 but usually i find myself optimizing reducing database accesses
 instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by
 grouping more operations into fewer transactions
 
 but this is beside the point if you have decent c experience and
 have poked around in java you should be able to convince most
 employers that you can be trusted writing java thats what i did 
 i mean i joined kana from microsoft and i didnt exactly write
 a lot of java code at microsoft
 
   im not displeased youre trying to help just frustrated that
   employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with
   insane years of experience
 
 i dont think ive ever interviewed at a place where i actually
 met all the prerequisites do you just give up when you dont
 
   interview tommorow with kodak doing i have no idea what as the
   recruiter isnt even sure but cross your fingers it wont require 
   years of java and  years of windowsias device driver 
 experience
   both common requirements
 
 i wish you best of luck and i apologies for being a bitch
 but god damn you piss me off sometimes my son occasionally
 displays your cantdo attitude and i do my damnest to
 get him to reverse course
 
  joe
