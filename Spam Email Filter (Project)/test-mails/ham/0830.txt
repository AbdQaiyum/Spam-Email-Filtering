this situation wouldnt have happened in the first place if california
didnt have economically insane regulations  they created a regulatory
climate that facilitated this  so yes it is the product of
overregulation


which is to say if you reduce the argument to absurdity that law causes 
crime 

yes i agree that badly written law can make life so frustrating that people 
have little choice but to subvery it if they want to get anything done this 
is also true of corporate policies and all other attempts to regulate 
conduct by rules rules just dont work well when situations are fluid or 
ambiguous but i dont think that the misbehavior of energy companies in 
california can properly be called wellintentioned lawbreaking by parties who 
were trying to do the right thing but could do so only by falling afoul of 
some technicality

if you want to get to root causes we should probably go to the slaying of 
abel by cain perhaps we can figure out what went wrong then and roll our 
learning forward through history and create a forktopia

nonpartisanly which is to say casting stones on all houses whether 
bicameral or unicameral built on sand or on rock to the left of them or to 
the right of them of glass or brick or twig or straw
