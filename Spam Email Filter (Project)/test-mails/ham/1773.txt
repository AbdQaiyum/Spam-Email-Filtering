   i dont know how big that pickle would be maybe loading it each time
   is fine  or maybe marshalling

my tests train on about  msgs and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching  million bytes  i havent done anything to try to reduce its
size and know of some specific problem areas for example doing character
grams of long words containing highbit characters generates a lot of
database entries and i suspect theyre approximately worthless  otoh
adding in more headers will increase the size  so lets call it  meg
wink
