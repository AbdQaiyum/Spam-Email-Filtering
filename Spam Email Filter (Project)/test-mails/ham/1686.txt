im taking all my razored mail today and calling any  numbers i can
find  i say hi im calling everyone that spammed me today to raise their
cost of doing business  you have a great day  im told i should do it
from a pay phone so it costs them  cents per call  if more people did
this we could tie up their phone lines and cost them so much money they
could never make spam work

also fun is the simple die spammer die
