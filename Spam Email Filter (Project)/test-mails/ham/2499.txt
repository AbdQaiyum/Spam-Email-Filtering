teresas written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that tycos crooked 
ceo spent  on a shower curtain  for an umbrella stand  on 
coat hangers  on bedsheets and  for a wastebasket 

    naturally they assured her that not only is it possible to pay  for 
    your shower curtains and  for a wastebasket its a good thing to do 
    so practically essential then they explain how 

    sometimes the wastebasket is exposed said joel joves a designer with 
    offices in rancho santa fe and beverly hills if you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom then maybe we need a pewterfinished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room 

    thats fool money at work if you cant find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for   absolute tops youre not half trying
