i used async io on system v in the   time frame  i did it that
way cause i thought it was cool to see if i could keep the tape
spinning

i can believe linux is catching up to this but some ability to do async
io already existed in the unix world

 red hat linux advanced server provides many high end features such
as
 support for asynchronous io now read io no longer needs to stall
your
 application while waiting for completion
 
 could it be after  years without this feature unix finally catches
up
 to
 windows and has io that doesnt totally suck for nontrivial apps no
way
 
 ok so they do it with signals or a flag which is completely ghetto
but
 at
 least they are trying keep trying guys you got the idea but not the
 clue
