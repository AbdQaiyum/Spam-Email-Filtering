dq  but i think rsync is key its very efficient bandwidthwise and it
dq  allows you to select which ones you want just as well as wget would
dq  bandwidth is a much bigger issue for me and some other of the europeans
dq  involved than it would be for you guys   imo its by far the most
dq  efficient and scriptable way to do this stuff these days

dq it must be horrible being a dialup user in   if we can automate
dq rsync submission with good authentication it would be fine with me
dq the current rsync method is not sufficiently authenticated though

ill take a look at it  im sure theres got to be some reasonly easy way to 
have rsync carry itself over ssh and secure access using ssh keys

dq  i suggest we use the hughesfamilyorg server for rsyncing as we do for
dq  the corpussubmit stuff  in a separate subdirectory though  then
dq  ill take a look at getting a nightly hitfrequenciescollation system
dq  going

ok ill take a look at it
