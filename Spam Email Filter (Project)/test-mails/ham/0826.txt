the next world order
by nicholas lemann
the bush administration may have a brandnew doctrine of power
issue of 
posted 

when there is a change of commandand not just in governmentthe new people
often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
suspected this feeling seems especially intense in the bush
administration perhaps because bill clinton has been bracketed by a
fatherson team its easy for people in the administration to believe
that after an unfortunate eightyear interlude the bush family has
resumed its governanceand about time too

the bush administrations sense that the clinton years were a waste or
worse is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs
republicans tend to regard democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
foreign policy anyway in ways that coincide with what people think of as
clintons weak points an eagerness to please a lack of discipline
condoleezza rice bushs nationalsecurity adviser wrote an article in
foreign affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused clinton
of an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
commander in chief most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
administration also served under the presidents father they took office
last year after what they regard as eight years of smalltime flyswatting
by clinton thinking that they were picking up where theyd left off

not long ago i had lunch withsorrya senior administration
foreignpolicy official at a restaurant in washington called the oval
room early in the lunch he handed me a twentyseven page report whose
cover bore the seal of the department of defense an outline map of the
world and these words

defense strategy for the s
the regional defense strategy
secretary of defense
dick cheney
january 

one of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
communicating its drama actors professional athletes and even elected
politicians train for years go through a great winnowing and then perform
publicly people who have titles like deputy assistant secretary of defense
are just as ambitious and competitive have worked just as long and hard
and are often playing for even higher stakesbut what they do all day is go
to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings how possibly to
explain that some of the documents including the report that the senior
official handed me which was physically indistinguishable from a
highschool term paper represent the government version of playing
carnegie hall

after the fall of the berlin wall dick cheney then the secretary of
defense set up a shop as they say to think about american foreign
policy after the cold war at the grand strategic level the project whose
existence was kept quiet included people who are now back in the game at
a higher level among them paul wolfowitz the deputy secretary of
defense lewis libby cheneys chief of staff and eric edelman a senior
foreignpolicy adviser to cheneygenerally speaking a cohesive group of
conservatives who regard themselves as biggerthinking tougherminded and
intellectually bolder than most other people in washington donald
rumsfeld the secretary of defense shares these characteristics and has
been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years colin
powell then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mounted a
competing and presumably more ideologically moderate effort to reimagine
american foreign policy and defense a date was setmay  on which
each team would brief cheney for an hour cheney would then brief president
bush after which bush would make a foreignpolicy address unveiling the
new grand strategy

everybody worked for months on the fivetwentyone brief with a sense
that the shape of the postcold war world was at stake when wolfowitz and
powell arrived at cheneys office on may st wolfowitz went first but
his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour and cheney a hawk who
perhaps liked what he was hearing did not call time on him powell didnt
get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in
the world until a couple of weeks later cheney briefed president bush
using material mostly from wolfowitz and bush prepared his major
foreignpolicy address but he delivered it on august   the day that
iraq invaded kuwait so nobody noticed

the team kept working in  the times got its hands on a version of the
material and published a frontpage story saying that the pentagon
envisioned a future in which the united states could and should prevent
any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power a few weeks of
controversy ensued about the bush administrations hawks being
unilateralcontroversy that cheneys people put an end to with denials
and the counterleak of an edited softer version of the same material

as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton the cheney
teams efforts took on the quality of a parting shot the report that the
senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
clinton took office it is a somewhat bland opaque documenta scrubbed
meaning unclassified version of something more candidbut it contained the
essential ideas of shaping rather than reacting to the rest of the
world and of preventing the rise of other superpowers its tone is one of
skepticism about diplomatic partnerships a more forthright version of the
same ideas can be found in a short book titled from containment to global
leadership which zalmay khalilzad who joined cheneys team in  and
is now special envoy to afghanistan published a couple of years into the
clinton administration when he was out of government it recommends that
the united states preclude the rise of another global rival for the
indefinite future khalilzad writes it is a vital us interest to
preclude such a developmentie to be willing to use force if necessary
for the purpose

when george w bush was campaigning for president he and the people around
him didnt seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift along the lines of
the policy of containment of the soviet unions sphere of influence which
the united states maintained during the cold war in his first major
foreignpolicy speech delivered in november of  bush declared that a
president must be a cleareyed realist a formulation that seems to
connote an absence of worldremaking ambition realism is exactly the
foreignpolicy doctrine that cheneys pentagon team rejected partly
because it posits the impossibility of any one countrys ever dominating
world affairs for any length of time

one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist
attacks of september th have changed official foreignpolicy thinking
any chief executive of either party would probably have done what bush
has done so farmade war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic
security it is only now six months after the attacks that we are truly
entering the realm of presidential choice and all indications are that
bush is going to use september th as the occasion to launch a new
aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
direction rather than a specific war on terrorism all his rhetoric
especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress
since september th and all the information about his state of mind which
his aides have leaked indicate that he sees this as the nations moment of
destinya perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging
because it enhances bushs stature and opens the way to more assertive
policymaking

inside government the reason september th appears to have been a
transformative moment as the senior official i had lunch with put it is
not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american
publics usual resistance to american military involvement overseas at
least for a while the clinton administration beginning with the black
hawk down operation in mogadishu during its first year operated on the
conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties the allbombing
kosovo operation in clintons nexttolast year was the ideal foreign
military adventure now that the united states has been attacked the
options are much broader the senior official approvingly mentioned a 
study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies
which argued that the mass public is much less casualtyaverse than the
military or the civilian lite believes for example the study showed that
the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction the american
death total in the vietnam war was about fiftyeight thousand september
th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further

recently i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice rices
foreign affairs article from  begins with this declaration the united
states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its national interest
in the absence of soviet power i asked her whether that is still the
case i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role she said
immediately i think september th was one of those great earthquakes
that clarify and sharpen events are in much sharper relief like bush
she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
of mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible states now define the
national interest the latter goal by the way is newin bushs speech to
congress on september th americas sole grand purpose was ending
terrorism we talked in her west wing office its tall windows face the
part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their
standups in her bearing rice seemed less crisply military than she does
in public she looked a little tired but she was projecting a kind of
missionary calm rather than belligerence

in the foreign affairs article rice came across as a classic realist
putting forth the notions of power politics great powers and power
balances as the proper central concerns of the united states now she
sounded as if she had moved closer to the onepower idea that cheneys
pentagon team proposed ten years agoor at least to the idea that the
other great powers are now in harmony with the united states because of
the terrorist attacks and can be induced to remain so theoretically the
realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united
states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
challenge it or trying to balance against it rice said and i think what
youre seeing is that theres at least a predilection this time to move to
productive and coperative relations with the united states rather than to
try to balance the united states i actually think that statecraft matters
in how it all comes out its not all foreordained

rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
national security council and asked them to think seriously about how do
you capitalize on these opportunities to fundamentally change american
doctrine and the shape of the world in the wake of september th i
really think this period is analogous to  to  she saidthat is
the period when the containment doctrine took shapein that the events so
clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat and that its a big
global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
thought of as being in the coalition that has started shifting the
tectonic plates in international politics and its important to try to
seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of
that before they harden again

the national security council is legally required to produce an annual
document called the national security strategy stating the overall goals
of american policyanother government report whose importance is great but
not obvious the bush administration did not produce one last year as the
clinton administration did not in its first year rice said that she is
working on the report now

there are two ways to handle this document she told me one is to do it
in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out but its our view that
since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration its
important an awful lot has happened since we started this process prior
to  i cant give you a certain date when its going to be out but i
would think sometime this spring and its important that it be a real
statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction
that its going

it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago some
questions that dont appear to be settled yet but are obviously being
asked are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in
foreign affairs and how much change it is willing to try to engender
inside other countriesand to what end and with what means the leak a
couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture adding offensive
capability against rogue states departed from decades of official
adherence to a purely defensive position and was just one indication of
the scope of the reconsideration that is going on is the united states now
in a position to be redrawing regional maps especially in the middle east
and replacing governments by force nobody thought that the bush
administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms but plainly it
is and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
months ago

just before the  election a republican foreignpolicy figure suggested
to me that a good indication of a bush administrations direction in
foreign affairs would be who got a higherranking job paul wolfowitz or
richard haass haass is another veteran of the first bush administration
and an intellectual like wolfowitz but much more moderate in  he
published a book titled the reluctant sheriff in which he poked a little
fun at wolfowitzs famous strategy briefing of the early nineties he
called it the pentagon paper and disagreed with its idea that the united
states should try to be the worlds only great power over the long term
for better or worse such a goal is beyond our reach haass wrote it
simply is not doable elsewhere in the book he disagreed with another of
the wolfowitz teams main ideas that of the united states expanding the
democratic zone of peace primacy is not to be confused with hegemony
the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic haass
argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world not
more and suggested a revival of what might be called traditional
greatpower politics

wolfowitz got a higherranking job than haass he is deputy secretary of
defense and haass is director of policy planning for the state department
in effect colin powells bigthink guy recently i went to see him in his
office at the state department on the wall of his waiting room was an
array of photographs of every past director of the policyplanning staff
beginning with george kennan the father of the containment doctrine and
the first holder of the office that haass now occupies

its another indication of the way things are moving in washington that
haass seems to have become more hawkish i mentioned the title of his book
using the word reluctant was itself reflective of a period when foreign
policy seemed secondary and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
to make he said it was written when bill clinton was saying its the
economy stupidnot its the world stupid two things are very
different now one the president has a much easier time making the case
that foreign policy matters second at the top of the nationalsecurity
charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism

i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
kennans containment i think there is he said what youre seeing from
this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
ideasim not sure it constitutes a doctrineabout what you might call the
limits of sovereignty sovereignty entails obligations one is not to
massacre your own people another is not to support terrorism in any way
if a government fails to meet these obligations then it forfeits some of
the normal advantages of sovereignty including the right to be left alone
inside your own territory other governments including the united states
gain the right to intervene in the case of terrorism this can even lead
to a right of preventive or peremptory selfdefense you essentially can
act in anticipation if you have grounds to think its a question of when
and not if youre going to be attacked

clearly haass was thinking of iraq i dont think the american public
needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein he said
also id fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the
case public opinion can be changed wed be able to make the case that
this isnt a discretionary action but one done in selfdefense

on the larger issue of the american role in the world haass was still
maintaining some distance from the hawks he had made a speech not long
before called imperial america but he told me that there is a big
difference between imperial and imperialist i just think that we have to
be a little bit careful he said great as our advantages are there are
still limits we have to have allies we cant impose our ideas on
everyone we dont want to be fighting wars alone so we need others to
join us american leadership yes but not american unilateralism it has
to be multilateral we cant win the war against terror alone we cant
send forces everywhere it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor

he stopped for a moment is there a successor idea to containment i think
there is he said it is the idea of integration the goal of us
foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
certain key ideas as to how the world should operate opposition to
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction support for free trade
democracy markets integration is about locking them into these policies
and then building institutions that lock them in even more

the first but by no means the last obvious manifestation of a new
american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein what
the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf whats
been done so far in afghanistan both in terms of the scale of the
operation itself and in terms of its aftermath

several weeks ago ahmad chalabi the head of the iraqi national congress
the iraqi opposition party came through washington with an entourage of
his aides chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask
evidently successfully for more american funding his main public event
was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute chalabis
leading supporter in town richard perle the prominent hawk and former
defense department official acted as moderator smiling and supremely
confident perle opened the discussion by saying evidence is mounting
that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
with saddam hussein the war on terrorism he said will not be complete
until saddam is successfully dealt with and that means replacing his
regime    that action will be taken i have no doubt

chalabi who lives in london is a charming suave middleaged man with a
twinkle in his eye he was dressed in a doublebreasted pinstriped suit
and a striped shirt with a white spread collar although he and his
supporters argue that the iraqi national congress with sufficient american
support can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the
taliban in afghanistan this view hasnt won over most people in
washington it isnt just that chalabi doesnt look the part of a rebel
military leader he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
over tea at the savoy but thats about it one skeptical former pentagon
official told me or that he isnt in iraq its also that saddams
military is perhaps ten times the size that the talibans was and has been
quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade the united
states left iraq in  believing that saddam might soon fall to an
internal rebellion chalabis supporters believe that saddam is much weaker
now and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
finish him off but nontrue believers seem to be coming around to the idea
that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of
anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground
troops

kenneth pollack a former cia analyst who was the national security
councils staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton
administration recently caused a stir in the foreignpolicy world by
publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam
this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two coauthors
published an article also in foreign affairs arguing that the iraqi
national congress was incapable of defeating saddam pollack still doesnt
think chalabi can do the job he believes that it would require a
substantial american ground air and sea force closer in size to the one
we used in kuwait in  than to the one we are using now in
afghanistan

pollack who is trim quick and crisp is obviously a man who has given a
briefing or two in his day when i went to see him at his office in
washington with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
walked over to his office wall where three maps of the middle east were
hanging the only way to do it is a fullscale invasion he said using a
pen as a pointer were talking about two grand corps two to three
hundred thousand people altogether the population is here in the
tigriseuphrates valley he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra
ideally youd have the saudis on board he pointed to the prince sultan
airbase near riyadh you could make kuwait the base but its much easier
in saudi you need to take western iraq and southern iraqpointing
againbecause otherwise theyll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil
fields you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil
fields so troops have to occupy them and you need troops to defend the
kurds in northern iraq point point you go in as hard as you can as
fast as you can he slapped his hand on the top of his desk you get the
enemy to divide his forces by threatening him in two places at once his
hand hit the desk again hard then you crush him smack

that would be a reverberating blow the united states has already removed
the government of one country afghanistan the new government is obviously
shaky and american military operations there are not completed pakistan
which before september th clearly met the new test of national
unacceptability it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
destruction will also require longterm attention since the country is
not wholly under the control of the government as the murder of daniel
pearl demonstrated and even parts of the government like the intelligence
service may not be entirely under the control of the president in iraq
if america invades and brings down saddam a new government must be
establishedan enormous longterm task in a country where there is no
obvious plausible new leader the prospective iraq operation has drawn
strong objections from the neighboring nations one of which russia is a
nuclear superpower an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations iran turkey saudi
arabia and even egypt events have forced the administration to become
directly involved in the israelipalestinian conflict as it hadnt wanted
to do so its really the entire region that is in play in much the way
that europe was immediately after the second world war

in september bush rejected paul wolfowitzs recommendation of immediate
moves against iraq that the president seems to have changed his mind is an
indication in part of the bureaucratic skill of the administrations
conservatives these guys are relentless one former official who is
close to the high command at the state department told me resistance is
futile the conservatives other weapon besides relentlessness is
intellectualism colin powell tends to think case by case and since
september th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
the beginning of a coherent hawkish world view whose acceptance
practically requires invading iraq if the united states applies the
doctrines of cheneys old pentagon team shaping and expanding the zone
of democracy the implications would extend far beyond that one operation

the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with
the administration seem to be bernard lewis of princeton and fouad ajami
of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies both of whom
see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation lewis
was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior
foreignpolicy staff one point he made is look in that part of the
world nothing matters more than resolute will and force the senior
official i had lunch with told mein other words the united states neednt
proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the arab street as long as it is
prepared to be strong the senior official also recommended as interesting
thinkers on the middle east charles hill of yale who in a recent essay
declared every regime of the arabislamic world has proved a failure
and reuel marc gerecht of the american enterprise institute who published
an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in
iran and syria those goals gerecht told me when we spoke could be
accomplished through pressure short of an invasion

several people i spoke with predicted that most or even all of the
nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on
if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to
finish the job one purpose of vicepresident cheneys recent diplomatic
tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter while gamely
absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation in any event the
administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
the worlds approval when i spoke to condoleezza rice she said that the
united states should assemble coalitions of the willing to support its
actions rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
of international treaties and organizations an invasion of iraq would test
that policy in more ways than one the administration would be betting that
it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly
opposed the iraq operation

when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year it asked
for a fortyeightbilliondollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
 which begins in october  much of that sum would go to improve
military pay and benefits but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
terrorism thats probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
iraq

this spring the administration will be talking to other countries about
the invasion trying to secure basing and overflight privileges while bush
builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction a drama
involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring
and summer and will end with the united states declaring that the terms
that saddam offers for the inspections involving delays and restrictions
are unacceptable then probably in the late summer or early fall the
enormous troop positioning which will take months will begin the
administration obviously feels confident that the united states can
effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop
buildup and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the
republican guard the military key to the country to turn against saddam
and topple him on its own but the chain of events leading inexorably to a
fullscale american invasion if it hasnt already begun evidently will
begin soon

lewis scooter libby who was the principal drafter of cheneys
futureoftheworld documents during the first bush administration now
works in an office in the old executive office building overlooking the
west wing where he has a second smaller office a packet of
publicrelations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
his  novel the apprentice quotes the times calling him dick
cheneys dick cheney which seems like an apt description he appears
absolutely sure of himself and whether by coincidence or as a result of
the influence of his boss speaks in a tough confidential gravelly
rumble like condoleezza rice and bush himself he gives the impression of
having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right the only
truly prudent course

when i went to see libby not long ago i asked him whether before
september th american policy toward terrorism should have been
different he went to his desk and got out a large black looseleaf binder
filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle
east he looked through it for a long minute formulating his answer

let us stack it up he said at last somalia   the discovery
of the al qaedarelated plot in the philippines  the world trade
center first bombing  the attempt to assassinate president bush
former president bush and the lack of response to that the lack of a
serious response to that  the riyadh bombing  the khobar
bombing  the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy
bombing  the plot to launch millennium attacks  the bombing of
the cole throughout this period infractions on inspections by the iraqis
and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime and the
failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas
no one would say these challenges posed easy problems but if you take that
long list and you ask did we respond in a way which discouraged people
from supporting terrorist activities or activities clearly against our
interests did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
further aggressions against us interests many observers conclude no
and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise
up and say credibly the americans dont have the stomach to defend
themselves they wont take casualties to defend their interests they are
morally weak 

libby insisted that the american response to september th has not been
standard or foreordained look at what the president has done in
afghanistan he said and look at his speech to the joint session of
congressmeaning the state of the union message in january he made it
clear that its an important area he made it clear that we believe in
expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world
he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests and
he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem and to
begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
not a change of behavior on their part take the afghan case for example
there are many other courses that the president could have taken he could
have waited for juridical proof before we responded he could have engaged
in long negotiations with the taliban he could have failed to seek a new
relationship with pakistan based on its past nuclear tests or been so
afraid of weakening pakistan that we didnt seek its help this list could
go on to twice or three times the length ive mentioned so far but
instead the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
standing up for our interests the problem is complex and we dont know
yet how it will end but we have opened new prospects for relations not
only with afghanistan as important as it was as a threat but with the
states of central asia pakistan russia and as it may develop with the
states of southwest asia more generally

we moved on to iraq and the question of what makes saddam hussein
unacceptable in the administrations eyes the issue is not inspections
libby said the issue is the iraqis promise not to have weapons of mass
destruction their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait their
promise not to threaten other countries and other promises that they made
in  and a number of un resolutions including all the other problems
i listed whether it was wise or notand that is the subject of debateiraq
was given a second chance to abide by international norms it failed to
take that chance then and annually for the next ten years

whats your level of confidence i asked him that the current regime
will in fact change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by

he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
slowly and deliberately there is no basis in iraqs past behavior to have
confidence in goodfaith efforts on their part to change their behavior
