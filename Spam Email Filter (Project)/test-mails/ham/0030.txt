     just cvs uped and nowadays catchup unseen is extremely slow o
 n 
     large  msgs unseen sequences anybody else having this proble
 m
    
    ill take the blame
    
    the reason i suspect is that were needlessly reading the sequence
 s file 
    multiple times because of other sequences  i need to make the code m
 uch 
    smarter about handling that file but first i have a few other fish t
 o fry in 
    my rather large patch thats on its way
    
   
   no panic
   
   im all for cleaning things up before getting it optimized
  
  okay this fix is now checked in
  
 im afraid it didnt help it still seems to be slower than  month 
 ago maybe slightly faster than yeasterday im still seeing an 
 unseen countdown in the log

okaycatchup unseen is something that i dont use often but i can 
certainly reproduce this  ill dig into it  its probably simple
