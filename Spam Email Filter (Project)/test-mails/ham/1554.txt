i successfully installed spamassassin  razor to run system wide on my
debian woody server  
 
briefly i 
aptget installed spamassassin razor and libmilterdev
 
downloaded spamassmiltertargz from httpwwwmilterorg
ungzipped and untarred the file into etcmail 
 
followed the directions in etcmailspamassmilterreadme to
compile the milter install the rc scripts and edit and update
sendmailmc
 
changed etcdefaultspamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode
 
verified that spamassassin was running by tailing varlogmaillog
 
 
woodystable has sa 
woodyunstable has sa 

im running the stable source live right now and it is working very
well

if you want unstable change etcaptsourceslist substituting
unstable for stable
run aptget update
install the unstable versions
change etcaptsourceslist
run aptget update
