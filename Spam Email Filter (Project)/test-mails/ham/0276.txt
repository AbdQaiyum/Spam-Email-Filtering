while i was playing with the past issues it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing i dont mean to truncate it
i mean to just freeze it for a while

the following patch adds a new button to the log window which allows
the log to be switched onoff the button says disable when the
log is enabled and the button disables it and enable when the log
is frozen and the button enables it again
