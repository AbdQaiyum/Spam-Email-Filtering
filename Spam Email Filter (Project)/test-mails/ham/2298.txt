the distributednet project  a precursor to setihome that used volunteer 
computertime to attack giant sophisticated ciphers  has cracked rc i 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this 

    on jul a relatively characterless piii in tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributednet keyservers the key xdedcfd 
    produces the plaintext output 

    the unknown message is some things are better left unread 

    unfortunately due to breakage in scripts dbakers fault naturally on 
    the keymaster this successful submission was not automatically detected 
    it sat undiscovered until aug the key was immediately submitted to 
    rsa labs and was verified as the winning key
