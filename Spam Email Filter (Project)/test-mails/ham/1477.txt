 i think ive worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a
 score  im just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle
 for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base

this is exactly what i think spamassassin has always been conservative
about adding unproven rbls and such and this should be the same

 i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less aggressive
 score one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyones
 inbox and after weve seen evidence that the system works then we can
 increase the magnitude of the score

i say start it with a zero score and put it in cvsrulesundertest like
any other unproven rule then score it based on actual results not
promises my corpus does not yet contain a single nonspam or spam message
with a habeas mark based on that it doesnt impress me and it wouldnt
impress the ga either rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from sa right now and i dont see why this should be any different
