   thanks a lot   the rpms seem to be fine they worked for me out of
   the box on vanilla valhalla wlatest errata
  
  except that i dont see an init script in the rpms a sample one
  designed for rh is supposed to be in utilsalsasound  could you take
  a look if it can be included
 
 it doesnt need to as red hat linux already sets correct permissions on all
 alsa audio devices for locally logged in users through the consoleperms
 file and the modulesconf files takes care of loading the right modules on
 demand also aumix and the scripts that come with red hat linux still work
 for controlling the volume so its still saved and restored when the
 computer is halted even using alsa

ah  the mixer stuff was what made me look for an init script in the
first place i didnt bother to check whether the existing stuff would
have worked with that  will try that out you can assume silence 
success 

 from what i can tell after only  days using it  alsa rocks especially
 since having a full oss compatibility results that it breaks nothing at
 all 

agreed  though with only  hours experience
