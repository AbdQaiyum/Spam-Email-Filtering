lol  theyre not doomed at all  thousands of men wear cbs to work 
every day along with other chastity devices    they are not just 
decorations  you will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to  anyhow i know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a nilla but these men wear these happily and 
consensually    there is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these  there is power exchange instead  lots of 
variations on the definition but this ones from gloria brames site

power exchange the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant the exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive 

anyhow there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them but i assure you the chastity device business is doing very 
well and it is illegal to force someone to wear one  its not coercion 
it is creative sensuality

 chastity technologies were doomed from the start and ill add chemical 
 ones to the trash heap  yeah cindy these are decorative toys for the 
 subculture but  
 
 generallysomeone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this 
 nonsense when quite plainly the the relationship is in a state where 
 preserving it is of little value  hardware is of no real use save for 
 playing the powerstruggle game   i dont want to see the future of this
 invisible fence for your mate   must wear location transponders and 
 endocrine monitors   more movies like minority report
 
 it seems so automatic for people to reach for coercive solutions   so 
 surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense 
 of overwhelming force advantage
