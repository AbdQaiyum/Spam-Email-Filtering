 lately ive got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower i 
 just decided to check that vs reality and yes speed has left the 
 scene somewhere between the release of  and now
 
 i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder  
 msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably
 
 release  msec
 latest cvs  msec
 
 frankly i think this is getting close to nonacceptable since the 
 user settings hasnt changed
 
 anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared
 most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences
 im sure it can be tuned a bunch but as im leaving for a vacation on
 friday  and have plenty of real work to do i wont be able to do
 much until i get  back

 i will look at all this when i get back but if you want to check
 into  whats slow and fix things while im gone my feelings wont be
 hurt

 chris 

just one more info i measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
ftocnext with time  so the data is for real one difference 
between mine and valdis setup judging from his trace is that i use 
the address book ive been doing that for ages so that cant be the 
problem

is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity
