jh they are legally required to do that  i got a similar check because an
jh insurance company didnt pay a claim quickly enough  it might have been
jh 

jh although they spent lots more than  to mail you the check the
jh alternative seems to be to keep the money  do you really want companies
jh to have a financial incentive to overbill you just a bit so they
jh could keep it  for a company with millions of customers customer
jh starts adding up


christ you sound worse than me

what i said in my post john was that instead of having to dole out
stupid refunds id rather they save the costs incurred knock off one
of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting
services like these and move on  something tells me itd balance
out  problem is theyre silly they dont want to do this and
rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of
controlling the situation overcharging they impose silly
requirements like this

 so i get a check from pac bell today sbc as theyre called now
 turns out they went to the trouble of printing out signing sealing
 and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole 
 
 they easily spent more than this just getting the materials together
 why the hell do companies bother to do this crap  i mean isnt there
 a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness  i dont think i missed
 the  but i sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu
 of being returned pennies
 
 im truly stuck on this though  i dont know whether to frame the
 check burn it or cash it in  maybe i should find a way to return to
 sender so they have to spend more money on giving me my  dues
 
 
 does  even buy anything anymore  funny bit of it is i couldnt
 even make a phone call these days
