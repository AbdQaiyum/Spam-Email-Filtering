 aptget install 
mntcdromlinuxcdburnercdrtoolscdrecordairpm
processing file dependencies done
reading package lists done
building dependency tree done
e couldnt find package 
mntcdromlinuxcdburnercdrtoolscdrecordairpm

the file cdrtoolscdrecordairpm is there

i performed another test copying the file 
cdrtoolscdrecordairpm to rootdownload

 aptget install rootdownloadcdrtoolscdrecordairpm
processing file dependencies done
reading package lists done
building dependency tree done
e couldnt find package rootdownloadcdrtoolscdrecordairpm
