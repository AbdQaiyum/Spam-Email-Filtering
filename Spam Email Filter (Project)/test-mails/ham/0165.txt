  chat tends to be on ircquakenet forteana most nights i think this was
  done mainly because of troll infestation  colin has control most nights on
  there and he keeps an eye on people and kicks them if they come in under
  assumed names or as soon as they show their true natures  just call him
  billy goat gruff 

how do you sign up

thanks

frogstone is still there and also forteana if you want to go to 
quakenet just change your server in mirc if that is what you use 
to that
