im happy to announce the first public release of neudist

neudist is an open source software framework for building applications
for the neubia distributed clearing platform

this release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers

talking about documentation it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in javaxml development

there are currently no sample applications but they will be available
in the next release

the framework currently contains the following
 classes for creating named objects which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy
 storage framework for named objects
 simple xmlsignature implementation almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations
 simple soap client
 simple servlet api for handling soap requests based on named
  objects
 current types of named objects include
    namespace objects  for maintaining the namespace authentication
 	framework
    authenticationtickets  for doing web site authentication using
	digital signatures


next major release is scheduled to contain
  core
	hard coded root public key for authenticating top level 	namespaces
  signing services
	implementation of web based signing services
	end user hosted signing service
  example user authentication application
  example payment system based on neudist

i will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks this will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things
