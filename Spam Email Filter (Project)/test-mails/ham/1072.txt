  at work i have to use outlook  ick  i hate it  
 
 ahh  at work we fire people who use outlook literally true they get
 escorted to the door their badge confiscated and told to return the
 next day to collect their office contents

why  what threat does outlook pose to your organization

  but it does a few things right  like making indices for each folder
  and not just by date but also by sender message size subject  so i
  can sort by any column instantly
 
 have you looked into using a custom sequences file

more detail please  i do use sequences so im familiar with their
use but how can i make indices with them and how can i keep them
up to date

  and mime handling is pretty bad compared with modern mailers
 
 the only thing i actually miss in that regard is support for smime

youre probably running exmh on a local machine  im running it on
a very remote machine  in this scenario the mime handling is weak
