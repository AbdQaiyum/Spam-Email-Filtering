 subject re the curse of indias socialism
 
 
 
 when id read that getting legal title
 can take  years when i believe that
  year ought to be more than sufficient
 and helped by the cairo reference id
 assumed that we were talking about the
 urban poor
 
 if i see people living in mansions or
 even in suburban subdivisions i assume
 they didnt have too much trouble with
 their titles

pg 
in another country a local newspaper intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings checked to see if the head of states
official residence had a recorded title  it did not

pg 
the value of land in the formal sector of lima averages us per square
meter whereas in the area of gamarra where a great deal of perus
informal manufacturing sector resides the value per square meter can go
as high as us



id have made the same assumption you did  de soto says that isnt
correct  you can find mansions that dont have title  a lot of them
in fact  but they cant be used for collateral for a loan or otherwise
participate as capital because of their extralegal status

 
  mr long i think youd particularly enjoy the de soto work
 
 on the to find list  any chance of
 an explanation of that bell jar in
 the meantime

french historian fernand braudel so braudels bell jar not de sotos



the key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past
which i would not hesitate to call capitalist should have lived as if
in a bell jar cut off from the rest why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society  why was it that a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time  it would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply money certainly was
not  so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built  how do we resolve the contradiction 
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of florence
under lorenzo the magnificent
 



de sotos theory is that the bell jar is formed when you segregate those
who have practical access to legal property rights and those who do
not  the poor have property  lots and lots of property  what they
dont have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing  their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally

 actual poor people not poor americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world
