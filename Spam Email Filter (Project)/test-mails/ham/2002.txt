stefan sez 

    a federal judge has determined that gas pipline manager el paso did indeed 
    limit natural gas supplies to california resulting in ruinous prices 
    rolling blackouts and smug cato institute flaks wagging their fingers at 
    hottubbers and environmentalists 

    california was sitting on a juicy dotcomera tax windfall before it all got 
    sucked away by this phony crisis 

    if i were gov davis id sieze every private pipeline powerline and 
    power plant and hold them hostage until the energy industry pays back every 
    dime they extorted from the state  

link discuss thanks stefan
