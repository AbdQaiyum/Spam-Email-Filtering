in article evmwespmenagedtensimcom you write

	ill have to try it with another window manager and see if i can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries i dont have this
problem with any other windows though just the exmhunseen window


how about enabling the show unseen message count in folder cache
option it displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
if greater than  so you dont really need the unseen window unless
youre using more sequences than just unseen

paul

	as hal noted i like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops even if the main window is minimized however i looked
through all the preferences menus and didnt see anything resembling show
unseen message count in folder cache where is that and in what version
im running v    creaky i know

	i went into twm with no virtual desktops and it came up just fine
going back to enlightenment i saw the same behavior as before then i knew
it must be something in the window manager so i went digging in my 
englightenmentesessionxxxxxxsnapshots file i found all the
settings that e uses for remembering border styles positions shaded
state etc 
	i have a x screen and it kept putting my window at
x and had it shaded to boot so it was tiny as well as offscreen
	searching for unseen in that file found this section

new exmhexmh
name exmh
class exmh
new unseenunseenwin
name unseen
class unseenwin
desktop 
res  
wh  
xy    
layer 
sticky 
skiptask 
skipwinlist 
skipfocus 
shade 
border pagerleftblue

	i changed
xy      	to 
xy    	so it would reappear in my viewable space
restarted enlightenment ctrlaltend and then restarted exmh bingo
there was my window 

	i quickly told englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style and now have a sveldt little entry like so

new exmhexmh
name exmh
class exmh
new unseenunseenwin
name unseen
class unseenwin
border pagerleftblue

	completely an enlightenment problem not exmh though i wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place i certainly cant move a window off
screen like that unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading

	hmm weird 

	anyway thanks for the suggestions folks hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future
