 the total collections are  messages  i trained with 
 messages

im reading this now as that you trained on about  spam and about 
ham  thats less than  of the sizes of the training sets ive been
using  please try an experiment  train on  of each and test once
against the other  of each  do that a few times making a random split
each time it wont be long until you discover why directories of individual
files are a lot easier to work  eg randomshuffle makes this kind of
thing trivial for me
