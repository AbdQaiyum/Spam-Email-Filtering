 i just installed razor  on a freebsd release box and having
 problems with razorcheck  any time razorcheck is run with or without
 arguments i get this error

 cant use an undefined value as a symbol reference at
 usrlocallibperlsiteperlifreebsdrazorclientagentpm
 line 

 try installing the latest perl at least  port on freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports ie in the
portslangperlfiles directory run useperl port reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again
