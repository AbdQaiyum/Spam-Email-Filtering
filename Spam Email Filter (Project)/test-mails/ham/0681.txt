 and with the crucial hair feature enabled

that got a good laugh out of me   just saying crucial hair feature 
improves my day immeasurably

ive done a fair amount of thinking about the media intermediated meeting 
thing   it seriously loses for reasons like rohits just encountered   
one is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same
some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial

id have never met my best friend if i had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know   i was a teen at the time but i wont say im much 
improved at being able to spot interesting at a distance   interesting 
isnt an external thing  i have that brought home to me again every so 
often  i may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever 
but thats total superstition   how do i know what your version of 
creative attire is  maybe its purely functional

i was at a loud party recently sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult and intoxication was the norm   i was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was women in order of attractiveness   i flinched from 
that rather violently   at a trade show or something i might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits   at a 
partywell if you cant hear the conversation they are having or if 
on the net all you have is a photo

you just cant tell important things from a picture and a few words  its 
not how we are built   theres no geek code for the heart and soul
and if there were people would lie and game the system
its too easy to say oh no  hes a geek   or shes a cat person 
ick when you might have a great time together

we are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people how we feel in the other persons company how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation   this is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
persons company   which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school

personally as a writer the whole internet meet  email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people but interestingly it 
doesnt   i have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results    i have to think its not the people but the tool

an aside okay yes im a tool geek  speed dating
speed dating aka  minute dating is a liveaction stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people compressed into one event   i think 
its noticably better but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together cooking climbing a mountain or whatever
it was in fact invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation   it has too much interview context 
and no shared activity beyond that   i give it several points for effort 
though 

i guess my impression that even the speed dating thing doesnt do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of join activities groups is 
actually sound
