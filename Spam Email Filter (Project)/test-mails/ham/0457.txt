 hi all
 
 ive repackaged the new gkrellm  which is now ported to gtk
 woohoo unfortunately the plugins are incompatible with the previous
 x ones and since not manyall have been ported yet i prefer not to
 release the package on the main freshrpmsnet site for now
 
 for those of you whod like to try it out you can grab it here 
 httpftpfreshrpmsnetpubfreshrpmstestinggkrellm
 
 i think the themes are still compatible but havent tried to install some
 with  yet
 last note the above packages are for valhalla and yes although gnome 
 is not in valhalla gtk and glib have been from the very beginning 

    sweet dude i was really hoping itd be out sooner or later thanks a bunch
