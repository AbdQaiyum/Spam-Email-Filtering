thank you lars for your reply to my query

 sa doesnt do any of these it is probably a function of whatever scanning
systemmda
 youre using amavis procmail whatever what exactly are you using

i am using spamassassin as part of the mailscanner package using sendmail
as the mta it integrates nicely in there and shares a configuration file
with sa all very neat

 sa in itself does nothing really you need a frontend procmail amavis
etc
 at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message
 to sa and do whatever other processing you want

i thought that sa rated a message with a certain score then did a certain
action such as store  deliver  delete based on the configuration given
i was hoping there were some other actions that i could customprogram in

again many thanks
