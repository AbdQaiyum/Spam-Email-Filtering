 i just had to jump in here as carbonara is one of my favourites to make and 
 ask 
 what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream 

isnt it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon or pancetta 
really you mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg thats my understanding
