 greg ward is
 currently capturing a stream coming into pythonorg and i hope we can get a
 more modern and cleaner test set out of that

not yet  still working on the required config changes  but i have a
cunning plan

 but if that stream contains
 any private email it may not be ethically possible to make that available

it will  part of my cunning plan involves something like this

  if folder  accepted              ie not suspected junk mail
      if lenrecipients   and
          recipients in guidopythonorg barrypythonorg 
          folder  personal

if you and guido barry et al prefer i could change that last
statement to folder  none so the mail wont be saved at all  i
might also add a and sender doesnt look like bounce request
admin  clause to that if statement

 can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample apart from a
 public mailing list  everyones eager to share their spam but spam is so
 much alike in so many ways thats the easy half of the data collection
 problem

i believe the spamassassin maintainers have a scheme whereby the corpus
of nonspam is distributed ie several people have bodies of nonspam
that they use for collectively evolving the sa score set  if that
sounds vague it matches my level of understanding
