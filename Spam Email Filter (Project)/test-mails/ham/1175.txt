two issues

snip
sorry but the following packages have unmet dependencies
  openssh depends openssl  a but b is installed
  phppgsql depends postgresql but it is not installed
             depends libpqso
e unmet dependencies try using f
snip

 i have the following openssl packages installed

snip
opensslperlb
opensslb
opensslaa
openssldevelb
snip

the openssla package should provide the openssla compatibility 
but apt doesnt think so 

 i have postgresql installed from the source so thats why i need 
phppgsql is there a way to tell apt about packages i dont want it to 
complain about
