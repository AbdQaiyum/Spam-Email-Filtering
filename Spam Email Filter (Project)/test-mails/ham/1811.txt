  perhaps more useful would be if tim could check in the pickles
  generated by one of his training runs so that others can see how
  tims training data performs against their own corpora

 i did that yesterday but seems like nobody bit

i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything
systematic  it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa
but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope
geeks list that happened to be using mime andor html

so i guess ill have to retrain it yes you told me so 

 just in case wink i
 uploaded a new version just now  since mincount went away unknownspamprob
 is much less likely and theres almost nothing that can be pruned away so
 the file is about x larger now
