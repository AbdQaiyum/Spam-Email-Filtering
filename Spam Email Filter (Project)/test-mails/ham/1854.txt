ive been running hammie on all my incoming messages and i noticed that
multipartalternative messages are totally hosed they have no content
just the mime boundaries  for instance the following message


from somebody someonesomewhereorg
to nealewoozleorg
subject booga
contenttype multipartalternative boundarysnot

this is a multipart message in mime format

snot
contenttype textplain charsetiso
contenttransferencoding bit

hi there
snot
contenttype texthtml charsetiso
contenttransferencoding bit

prehi therepre
snot


comes out like this


from somebody someonesomewhereorg
to nealewoozleorg
subject booga
contenttype multipartalternative boundarysnot
xhammiedisposition no  unrelated gar removed

this is a multipart message in mime format

snot

im using python a  sep    

ive fixed it with the following patch to tims tokenizer but i have to
admit that im baffled as to why it works  maybe theres some subtle
interaction between generators and lists that i cant understand  or
something  being as im baffled i dont imagine any theory i come up
with will be anywhere close to reality

in any case be advised that at least for me hammie will eat
multipartalternative messages until this patch is applied  the patch
seems rather bogus though so im not checking it in in the hope that
theres a better fix i just wasnt capable of discovering
