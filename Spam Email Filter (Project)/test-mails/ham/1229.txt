ive had this binding in my exmhexmhbindings for years

set bindingskeyflistfindunseen   incpresortfinish keyf

after updating to the current code in cvs i get bad key f when 
i hit the f key  i can open the bindings commands window 
and define the binding  it then works until i restart exmh

i suspect a parsing problemchange  ill try to look into this 
tomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be
