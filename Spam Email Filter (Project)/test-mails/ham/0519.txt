 it also depends on what the fad is or what is in style  

dnas idea of fads is on the  kiloyear scale unfortunately as long as
current fads dont involve invivo rewrite of the genome homeoboxes
including now theres a problem for you homeoboxing the adult theyre
not all that smart an idear
 
 actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have
 resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page and musical
 instrumnet and canvas  whats the problem if we dash a little mrs

art is sure nice however if art is our first priority were kinda
fuxred if weve set our sight on a sustainable culture

 and let me tell you this just because a child happens to be
 singleparented what a word does not mean that child is
 dysfunctional or lives in a dysfunctional home  the govtmediachurch

our firmware is not built to be singleparented you can counteract that
somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends but not too
many do that

 has tried to make it look like there is a disintegration when in
 fact there is a coming together of other family members and friends
 to raise children  its not decaying  its changing  nothing wrong
 with change

i dont know what exactly is wrong but something is definitely wrong  
this is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is
right and what is wrong
  
  at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
  counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
  something wrong
  
  maybe we should really go dirty tleilaxu all the way
  
 
 maybe yall should buy mw some more bandwidth
