  patrick one of the features i really like about exmh is the
  patrick ability to see which folders have unseen messages in
  patrick them but recently it seems to have vanished into the
  patrick bowels of my window manager in a place i cant get
  patrick to it claims to be running but doesnt appear
  patrick anywhere onscreen im using enlightenment with a x
  patrick virtual desktop ive tried dropping it to only 
  patrick screen no help
  patrick

this may not helpwork but ive discovered recently that
altmiddlemouse pops up a list of all of my windows  if i leave
my mouse on the background it lists altmiddlemouse as display
task list menu

	when i do that it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
probably trying to center it on the offscreen window in question 

	ill have to try it with another window manager and see if i can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries i dont have this
problem with any other windows though just the exmhunseen window
