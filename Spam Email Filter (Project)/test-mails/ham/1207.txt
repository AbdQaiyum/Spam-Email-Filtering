  it did for me but i am not willing to say it is not a tcltk issue as
  other apps seemed to work ok for cut and paste and tk does its
  clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits so im not
  about to place blame just reporting my experience

one more salvo on x and cutpaste  x specifies at least two mechanisms
for cutpaste but as usual mandates no policy  windows and macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy  im quite
sure that tk implements all primary and clipboard selections accurately
the primary selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your x display  the clipboard selection is the one with the explicit
copy step and is the same as what you have on windows and macintosh
however exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point perhaps still today
by versions of emacs  exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella and by all reports it is not that great

i would encourage folks to play with those  lines of code in
textselection and report what works well for them  we may come up
with  lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models  of course
thats an admission of policy failure but im willing to do that
