 i have failed dependencies in rpm database to i am unable to use
 aptget  i requests to run aptget f install to fix these
 dependencies however i get these errors when running aptget f
 install 

 error unpacking of archive failed on file
 usrsharelibgcjzipcbe cpio md sum mismatch
 e subprocess binrpm returned an error code 
 rootlocalhost root 

id say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted maybe trying aptget
clean to remove all downloaded files first would solve the problem
