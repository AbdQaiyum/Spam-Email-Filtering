neale pickett
 
 if you can spare the memory you might get better performance in this
 case using the pickle store since it only has to go to disk once but
 boy does it ever go to disk  i cant think of anything obvious to
 speed things up once its all loaded into memory though

on my box the current system scores about  msgs per second starting in
memory of course  while that can be a drag while waiting for one of my
full test runs to complete one of those scores a message more than 
times and trains more than  times ive got no urge to do any speed
optimizations  if i were using this for my own email id never notice the
drag  guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his
msg batches to score but hes the boss so he bitches about everything
wink

 thats profiler territory and profiling is exactly the kind of
 optimization i just said i wasnt going to do 

i havent profiled yet but suspect there arent any egregious hot spots
graming of long words with highbit characters is likely overly expensive
when it happens but it doesnt happen that often and as an approach to
nonenglish languages it sucks anyway ie theres no point speeding
something that ought to be replaced entirely
