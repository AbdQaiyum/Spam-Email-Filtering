    k planning battle tactics for this reason the intelligence
    k press reports spy satellites have had meter resolution for
    k many years

the military already have these spy satellites they are basically
hubble pointed the other way so i doubt they will be a big enough
customer of this service to justify a nextgeneration wireless
network rollout for the rest of us

    k finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be
    k possible with m images and might occasionally also be worth
    k the money

my car is only just over  meters across and maybe  meters long so
that means roughly six pixels total surface area  you might find a
wheeler this way but how often do people misplace a wheeler
such that it is that important to get old images of the terrain
since they cant send up aircraft to update images in realtime every
time how is this different from just releasing the map on dvds  why
wireless

i thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle but there again
will there really be businesscase for creating a hires map of
wyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a
helicopter for a few hours

    k for small areas you have legitimate access to its probably
    k cheaper to go there with a digital camera and a gps and take
    k some snapshots from ground level  aerial photos might be
    k cheaper for large areas areas where youre not allowed  or
    k perhaps physically able  to go and cases where you dont
    k have time to send a ground guy around the whole area

i can see lowerres being useful for geologists but considering their
points of interest change only a few times every few million years
theres not much need to be wireless based on uptotheminute data
i expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of dvd
playback and i also expect the most interesting geology is in regions
where the wireless aint going to go 

i dont mean to nitpick its just that im curious as to a the
need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and b how wed
justify the ubiquitous nextgeneration wireless network that this
product postulates when we still cant find the killer app for g
