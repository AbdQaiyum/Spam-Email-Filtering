 of was a typo
 
 unbreakable would mean here that no one even previously authorised entity 
 could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee
 
  you need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
  solve and about the constraints involved
 
 it could be an online system that work  offline but poll frequently an 
 offsite server  no mass production cds maybe mass personalised dl like sun 
 jdk
 
 nothing is fixed yet we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
 from unauthorized utilisation  
 
 is the use of trusted hardware really worth it 

answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
model but in all probability no it isnt usually worth it so it
comes down to how difficult you want to make the crackers job

if the product requires occasional authentication simple copying
wont work the product has to be cracked in which case the issue is
whether youre actually going to enter into battle with the crackers
or just make sure that it isnt trivial

a lot of it comes down to your customer base teenage kids tend to be
more concerned about cost and less concerned about virusestrojans
and so more willing to use warez fortune corporations are likely
to view matters differently

 does it really make it more secure 

yes software techniques will only get you so far actually the same
is ultimately true for hardware but cracking hardware is likely to
require resources other than just labour

almost  anything can be reverse engineered but it may be possible
to ensure that doing so is uneconomical

 look at the dvds

iirc css was cracked by reverseengineering a software player and
one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that
