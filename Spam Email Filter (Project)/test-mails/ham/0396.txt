the interdisciplinary team

     confirmed speculation that the geckos amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der waals forces

     rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules and

 discovered that the geckos adhesive depends on geometry not surface 
chemistry in other words the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairsnot what they are made ofdetermine the geckos stickiness

to verify its experimental and theoretical results the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foothair tips from two 
different materials

both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted notes autumn assistant 
professor of biology at lewis  clark college in portland ore our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry adhesive microstructures which can have widespread 
applications
