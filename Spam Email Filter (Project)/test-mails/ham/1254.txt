    oooops
 
    doesnt work at all got this on startup and on any attempt to
    change folde r which fail
 
   chris sigh id already found that and checked it inapparently
   chris i did so after you checked it out and before you sent this
   chris maili hoped i was fast enough that you wouldnt see it
 
   chris try again
 
 
 works like a charm its like the box was on drugs or something 
 
 however while testing it a selected my favourite folder lk and 
 marked  messages unread that took forever or about as long as 
 catchup unseen did before any suggestions

thats fixed now  i thought id caught all the occurrences of that particular 
coding stupidity
