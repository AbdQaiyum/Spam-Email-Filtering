  well i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package
  built against something that wasnt installed through rpm 
 
 following that reasoning ive been installing all my custombuilt
 kernels through rpm recently i find it annoying though that 
 alsakernel and similar packages will only build for the currently 
 running kernel
 
 so ive attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
 targetkernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you
 still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed but at
 least it doesnt have to be currently running its kinda hackish so
 if someone has a better way to do this let me know

that idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more what
you sent doesnt support packages named kernelsmp id also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable and preferrably not editing the spec
probably define target xxxx with smp sound good enough
the buildrequires on kernelsource will also need to be removed because
it wont necessarily need to be true and that does bug me a bit 

more ideas are welcome
