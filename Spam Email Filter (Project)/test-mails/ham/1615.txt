 additional comments from jmjmasonorg    
 use of config is gradually being removed thankfully  i dont want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff

 perl has no concept of where the rules could be  unless theyre in
the perl libdir usrlibperlsiteperlxxfoo  perl does not
know about the existence of usrshare or etc  used to use usrlibperl
for storing rules and it was actually much worse than it is now so
we need an outofband way to tell sa where to find this stuff thats
the problem

 try perl makefilepl  devnull to allow bots to build it

i think i might be missing some details of what youre peeved about
though could you elaborate specifically
