 heres an interesting thing to test discriminate words differently if
 they are on a line that starts with  or to catch styles like
 above that the first occurance on a line of  or  is  to eliminate
 html

give me a mod to timtokenpy that does this and ill be happy to test it

 then again it may not be worth trying to unfalsepositive that
 nigerian scam quote

if theres any sanity in the world even the original poster would be glad
to have his kneejerk response blocked wink  otoh you know there are a
great many msgs on clpy all over usenet that do nothing except quote a
previous post and add a oneline comment  remove the quoted sections from
those and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers  so
i can see this nudging the stats in either direction  the only way to find
out for sure is for you to write some code wink
