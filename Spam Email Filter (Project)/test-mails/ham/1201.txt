 has anyone an answer for me the mplayer documentation still suggests to
 use them for x architectures

well i think my avifile build still needs the win codecs to be able to
run manually copied into usrlibwin but personally ive been very
happy with mplayers default which is ffmpegs ffdivx decoder for nearly
all the divx files i used the only ones that still require from my own
experience the use of the win codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
divx  sound format and ive really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them

  are there perhaps licensing issues which forbid such a practice or
  any other reasons
  
  the reason i ask is that i have seen performance and also some feature
  differences fullscreen wo keeping aspect ratio visual artifacts on
  nvidia comparing with or without the win codecs the mplayer authors
  seem to recommend using them for x architectures
  
  beware i am no mplayercodecswhatever expert i may be totally lost
