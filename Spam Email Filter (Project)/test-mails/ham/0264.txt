  ive two directories that once upon a time contained the same files
 
  now they dont
 
  is there a tool to merge the two  create a new directory where if the
 files are the same they arent changed if they are different the one
 with the most recent datestamp is used

just for the record mc has a nice directory
comparison function this is really nice
when using the ftp vfs for eg of course
if you use something like ftpfs you can use
the previously mentioned tools
