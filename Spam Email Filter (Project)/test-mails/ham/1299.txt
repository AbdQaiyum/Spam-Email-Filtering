 im facing another problem right now it looks like libsigc is no
 longer included in the distribution and gtkmm wont compile without it
  i guess ill have to repackage it myself for  assuming its
 possible

well ive made an updated libsigc  package it rebuilds cleanly on
 but the so libraries are missing when trying to rebuild on  the
a and la files and everything else is though
do you have an idea of what the problem may be julian  do you want the
srcrpm to try to find the cause
