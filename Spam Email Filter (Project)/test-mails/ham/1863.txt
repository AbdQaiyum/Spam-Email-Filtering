 they werent partitioned in any particular scheme  i think ill write a
 reshuffler and move them all around just in case fwiw im using mh 
 style folders with numbered files  means you can just use mh tools to 
 manipulate the sets

freak show obviously there was some sort of patterns to the data

total false pos  
total false neg  

before the shuffle i was seeing
total false pos  
total false neg  


for sake of comparision heres what i see for partitioned into  sets
