 case of headers is definitely helpful  spamassassin has a rule for it
  if you have headers like date or subject you get a few more
 points

across my data allcaps date subject to etc indeed appear only in the
spam collections  otoh they dont appear often  less than  of spam
messages have at least one of these allcap header lines  but when im
fighting what are now sub fn rates even rare clues can help
