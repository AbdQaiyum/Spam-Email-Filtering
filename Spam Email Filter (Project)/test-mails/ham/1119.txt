  thanks a lot   the rpms seem to be fine they worked for me out of
  the box on vanilla valhalla wlatest errata
 
 except that i dont see an init script in the rpms a sample one
 designed for rh is supposed to be in utilsalsasound  could you take
 a look if it can be included

ok some more nits alsaxmms doesnt work if i dont have
alsalibdevel installed but xmms dies on startup telling me

   cannot load alsa library libasoundso cannot open shared object
   file no such file or directory

libasoundso is part of alsalibdevel if i install it the alsa xmms
output plugins works fine

i cant install the xine stuff because xinelibs needs libglcoreso
which i cant find anywhere nvidia stuff  i have radeon
