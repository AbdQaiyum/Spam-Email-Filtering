  i just set up razor and spamassassin but i keep getting this error in my 
  mail log file
  
  razor check skipped no such file or directory cant call method log on 
  unblessed reference at 
  usrlocallibperlsiteperlrazorclientagentpm line 
  
  i have looked through the archived list and the only thing i have seen 
  about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file
 
 yeah the answer isnt here in this list its on the spamassassinusers
 list  i just asked it late last week
 
 hint  add h to the spamd startup flags using the latest version of
 spamassassin
