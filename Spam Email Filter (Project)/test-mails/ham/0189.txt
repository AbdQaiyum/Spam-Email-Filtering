 hi
 
 in my build scripts i have problems with some of the kernel packages
 
 for kernelsources i get 
 
 package kernelsource is a virtual package provided by
   kernelsource 
   kernelsource 
 
 on running aptget install kernelsource
 
 now first of all this doesnt really tell me what the two options are 
 second is there some way i can tell aptget to install either  this is 
 done from automatic build scripts so id like it to proceed anyway

thats just apts way of telling you the package is in allowduplicated 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time yes the output is a bit strange especially when theres only one 
version available

aptget install kernelsource will install it
