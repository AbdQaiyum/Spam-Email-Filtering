john robb has an interesting perspective on trustbased targetted advertising
 based on his experiences at gomez during the heady days of the internet 
gold rush 

nobody believes advertisements any more theres a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesnt work no matter how targetted so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side where 
consumers defenses are lowered product placements are one example of this 

there is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons here when advertising first 
rose to prominence advertisements did work we hadnt built up our 
immunities yet as more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie we learned not to trust advertisements but we still trust editorial 
and once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using pr instead 
of advertising to promote their message nobody will believe it either
