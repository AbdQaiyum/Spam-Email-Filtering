this is just an semieducated guess  if im wrong someone please correct
me

spamd setuids to the user running spamc since youre calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file its being run as root most likely if called as
root spamd wont open userprefs files

from the spamc man page

       u username
           this argument has been semiobsoleted  to have spamd use
           peruserconfig files run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load  if youre running spamc as some
           other user though eg root mail nobody cyrus etc
           then you can still use this flag


the solution is to set dropprivsyes in etcprocmailrc just before running
spamc from the procmailrc man page

       dropprivs   if set to yes procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had suid or sgid  this  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the etcprocmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient


i hope that helps and i also hope its right

 hi all

 i am running spamassassin  with procmail as my local delivery agent
 with sendmail  i use spamcspamd so that it runs sitewide from
 etcprocmailrc

 spamd is run as root with the flags d a c and spamc isnt run with
 any flags

 when i was testing the program i deployed spamc from my personal
 procmailrc file my spamassassinuserprefs file was read each time
 i can see this because i have a nondefault requiredhits value which
 gets reported in every email on the xspamstatus line

 now that i run spamc from the global etcprocmailrc file my
 spamassassinuserprefs file is no longer being read or processed from
 emails from outside computers  the requiredhits value gets set back
 to the one in etcmailspamassassinlocalcf  however if i send local
 email my userprefs file is read and processed correctly

 does anyone know how to fix this problem  if this is a spamassassin or
 procmail bug

 thanks

 cheryl
