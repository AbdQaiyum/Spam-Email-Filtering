this situation wouldnt have happened in the first place if california
didnt have economically insane regulations  they created a regulatory
climate that facilitated this  so yes it is the product of
overregulation

 from slates todays papers  
 the new york times and los angeles times both lead with word that
 a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nations largest
 national gas pipeline company el paso illegally withheld gas
 from the market during californias energy squeeze in 
 the judge concluded that el paso left  percent of its capacity
 in the state offline thus driving up the price of gas and
 helping to induce rolling blackouts 
 
 and this is the product of overregulation
