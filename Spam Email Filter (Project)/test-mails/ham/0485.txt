 missaglia italy reuters  husbands eyes wandering make yourself sexier
 at least thats the solution proposed by an italian mayor  and a woman
 mayor at that
 
 wives in the northern town of missaglia had complained to mayor marta
 casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace
 
 they complained that the men in the town of some  people were spending
 too much time ogling so they asked casiraghi to order the woman to put her
 clothes back on
 
 but the mayor far from sympathizing told the wives to get sexy if they
 wanted to keep their men the girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
 sun topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays
 theres nothing we can do casiraghi told il nuovo a webbased newspaper
 
 instead id advise the wives to play their rival at her own game  make
 themselves more beautiful
