  well i have been doing a bit of fiddling with the ga i dont have
  a large corpus practically available to me or processable within
  reasonable processor time  i can justify the ga fiddling part as
  being part of my research but not the mail processing so in
  order to test out my changes someone needs to send me a copy of the
  tmpscoresh and tmptestsh that get generated prior to the ga
  going into action
 
 why not start with masscheck corpus results its much easier to get
 those

ah as in getting a directory listing of the corpus server and doing some
downloads ok done

 and you can create your own tmpscoresh and tmptestsh

good point will report back on my results
