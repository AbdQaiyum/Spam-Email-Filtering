with the increasing prevalence of web services not that they are always a
good thing i doubt that parsing xml will be something that will remain at
the java application layer for long recent threads here on fork
indicating the move towards hardware parsing or this code even become part
of the native implementation of java on various platforms

    hardware is getting so fast that im not sure if the performance
  difference between java and cc are relevant any more

 when outofthebox parsing  transform of xml in java is x slower than
 c on the same hardware then it does matter

yea and that on top of the x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendianing it and passing the data x in the raw then it really
matters
