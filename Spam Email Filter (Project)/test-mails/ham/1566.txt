this may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere

i have setup two mx records mail and bmail for my mail server the one i
gave a  bmail the other a  mail

bmail i gave a  because i want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for spam and viruses and then relayed to the mail server for
delivery

as i understand it dns a records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing but dns mx records are used in order or prority meaning the 
before the  and only  if the  isnt available

but only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 
never goes down why have i got something confused here

thanks
