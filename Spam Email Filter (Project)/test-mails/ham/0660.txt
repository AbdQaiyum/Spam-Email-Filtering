    j what about tibetan buddhism btw  they seem like an awfully
    j nice bunch of chaps and chapesses

yes them too  when wolves attack their sheep they coral the wolf
into a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so

in samskar before the chinese arrived there had not been a killing
in over  years and the last recorded skirmish over rights to
a water hole had happened several generations ago
