yeah physical mail makes more sense for physical locales

 there are better technical solutions to privacy

anything equivalent will be spam just not email spam  dump entry ips for
an anonymizing network onto a public bulletin board thats used for other

im not arguing against other solutions im arguing that spam is speech  
if you let governments ban it youre giving them the power to choose who 
gets to speak
