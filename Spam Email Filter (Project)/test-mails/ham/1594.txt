 additional comments from easmithbeatricerutgersedu    
i like this idea but from my reading  part of my dissertation research 
on gas or in this case more precisely evolutionary programming since
the parameters are nonbinary and the major operator is mutation not
crossover you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables the bettertweaked the gaea will need to be
especially to avoid local optima which may have been the problem with the
suspiciouslyhigh antiratware useragent scores from past results
whats needed are one or more of the below
        a determine mutational parameters by adaptedscores themselves
           with variation on a peroriginal score basis ideally allow
           for having correlated mutations  in other words have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once with them all moving about the same amount albeit possibly
           in different directions  one means to do this is found in the
           evolutionary strategies of schwefel
        b adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done  if more than about a
           fifth of the new individuals are doing about as well as or
           better than the parental generation then mutate more
           parameters if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as or better than the parental generation then mutate less
           parameters
