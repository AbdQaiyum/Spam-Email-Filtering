well it looks pretty much  sure that we will be moving in on nov  to
the new house i think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapseso no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks

in preperation we drove to best buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net i got a linksys befws for the routerhubwireless
apfirewalletc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

i made one false move so it took about  mins all told to set up the
card the router and the other  machines in the house on the wire ether
hub all vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface i have to dig into the firewallnatrouting features some
more i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica
but all in all a smooth move


now the place im at now the house soon to be the ex house has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area we are in 
essentialy a gravel pitrecption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit  that being said with  walls and  feet between
the ap and the pcmica card no external antena on it im still getting
mbs and at least  goodness


some cool things about the new houseits a  job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of  mostly wood and plaster we dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on mhz yea so i can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing ben or heather if you read this years from nowwell by then i
hope youare better at countermoeasures 

ok enough testing for tonight i gota say being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blastoh nowifes pillow is
heading this wayduckkkkk
