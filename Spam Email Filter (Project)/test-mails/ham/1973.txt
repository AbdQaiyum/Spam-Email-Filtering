 phil ringnalda putting on the brakes so the answer to the 
question that started this whole project what is the rdf in rss  good 
for is two things its good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schemaaware program or its good for 
writing a schemaaware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasnt seen before thats actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success but at this point im sick of the 
whole thing so ill leave that project for someone else 
 aaron swartz tramp makes rdf look like python data structures 
rdfxml got you down tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data want to write python and be standardscompatible at the same time 
need a module to implement the psuedocode you had on your slides tramp may or 
may not be the answer to these problems complete with an example of 
parsing foaf files 
 dan connolly hyperrdf using xhtml authoring tools with xslt to produce 
rdf schemas xml syntax is a little tedious but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand rdf adds another layer of 
tedium but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand i make 
heavy use of reificationquoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
rdf this adds another layer of tedium that i find unmanageable and i have 
been writing xmlsgmlhtml by hand for  years also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in html
