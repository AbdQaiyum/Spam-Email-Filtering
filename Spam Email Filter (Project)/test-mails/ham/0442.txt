    i cant reproduce this error
 
 ah i think i just found the cause nmh is broken which is probably
 obvious from my previous mail
 
 the man page for pick and how it always used to work was that list
 would list messages matched  nolist would supress that   if sequence
 is given the default is nolist without sequence the default is list
 
 thats all fine  but it appears now which probably means i had never
 used pick since i upgraded nmh last that what counts is the order of
 list and sequence  that is if sequence comes after list the list
 gets turned off sequence implies nolist instead of just making nolist
 the default
 
 an easy workaround for this is to make sure that list is the last arg
 given to pick so if i run 
 
 delta pick inbox lbrace lbrace subject ftp rbrace rbrace   
 sequence mercury list
 
 
 which is just as it should be

hmmm i assume youre going to report this to the nmh folks
