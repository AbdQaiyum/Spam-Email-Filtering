actually  i clocked my long loop today and discovered that 
the run i thought was  miles is actually only  and the short 
loop i thought was  miles is actually only  i have an offby 
bug this is very upsetting ive lost  miles somewhere if anyone finds 
them can you please let me know thank you 

i ran  miles last week and  so far this week even taking into account my 
offby bug i fear i am turning into a runner my father and i made fun of 
runners when i was growing up he used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling wed drive by runners point at them and say look another 
runner not smiling this weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years so it is with some measure of shame that i admit that i am becoming a 
runner 

becoming a runner is actually not that difficult not surprisingly it involves 
running theres other stuff too eventually but running is the important 
part if you can run a mile run a mile if you can only run around the block 
run around the block tomorrow youll run around the block and the next day 
youll find you can run around two blocks and next week youll find you can 
run a mile then one day youll run a mile then stop to catch your breath 
then get invigorated and run another mile 

and then youre a runner thats it really its not complicated you run and 
you run and you run and one day you discover that shoes are important and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out arent actually very good for running so you go buy new shoes and 
you run and you run and you run and later you discover that stretching is 
important too so you stretch and run and stretch and run and stretch and 
run 

theres other stuff too but it doesnt really matter until youre already a 
runner you learn about differences in running surfaces and how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes and when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning and how to train for a marathon and so forth dont 
worry about any of that now just run running is key otherwise youre just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading runners world
