ive got a test set here thats the last  and a bit years email to
infoekitcom and infoeknocom  its a really ugly set of 
messages currently broken into  spam  ham  currently
unclassified these addresses are all over the some different 
ekiteknoisiconnect websites so they get a lot of spam

as well as the usual spam it also has customers complaining about 
credit card charges it has people interested in the service and 
asking questions about long distance rates c c c lots and lots 
of commercial speech in other words stuff that sa gets pretty 
badly wrong

im currently mangling it by feeding all parts text html whatever 
else  into the filters as well as both a selected number of headers 
to from contenttype xmailer and also a list of 
headercountofheader this is showing up some nice stuff  eg the 
xuidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages

i did have received in there but its out for the moment as it causes
rates to drop

im also stripping out html tags except for href and src  theres
so so much goodness in them note that im only keeping the contents of
the attributes
