im a new user or about to be hopefully of sa but ive run into some
compilation errors that prevent me from installing  rather than picking
through the code i thought id avoid reinventing the wheel and ask here
when i run the make i get the following

cc error spamdspamcc line  in this declaration inaddrt has no
linka
ge and has a prior declaration in this scope at line number  in file
usrinc
ludesystypesh nolinkage
typedef unsigned long   inaddrt       base type for internet address


cc warning spamdspamcc line  in this statement the referenced
type of
the pointer value msgbuf is char which is not compatible with
unsigned ch
ar ptrmismatch
  ifbytes  fullread in msgbuf maxsize maxsize 
maxsize

cc warning spamdspamcc line  in this statement the referenced
type of
the pointer value headerbuf is char which is not compatible with
const un
signed char ptrmismatch
    fullwrite outheaderbufbytes


there are lots more where they came from  any ideas what can be done
thanks in advance
