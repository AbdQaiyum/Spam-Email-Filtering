 the first computer to crack enigma was optical
 the first syntheticapertureradar processor was optical
 but all these early successes were classified   to  projects
 and i probably know of less than half

  do these claims compute is this really a secret history or does
 this mean holography of am i just completely out of the loop

gimme a break  this is remarkable for its lack of
newsworthiness

 bletchley park used optical sensors which were and
still are the best way to read paper tape at high speed
you can read about it in the standard accounts eg
  httpwwwpicotechcomapplicationscolossushtml

 for decades before that codebreakers were using optical
computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns
you can read about it in kahn

 people have been doing optoelectronic computing for
decades  theres a lot more to it than just holography
i get  hits from
  httpwwwgooglecomsearchqopticalcomputing

 optical info is a complexvalued wave spatial frequency amplitude and
 phase

it isnt right to make it sound like three numbers frequency
amplitude and phase  actually there are innumerable
frequencies each of which has its own amplitude and phase

 lenses refractions and interference are the computational operators
 add copy multiply fft correlation convolution of d and d arrays

 and of course massively parallel by default

 and of course allows freespace interconnects

some things that are hard with wires are easy with
lightwaves  but most things that are easy with wires
are hard with lightwaves

 heres a commercialized effort from israel a space integrating
 vectormatric multiplier   a  b   c 
 laser gate modulator  spread over d
  teraflop equivalent for one multiply per nanosecond

people were doing smaller versions of that in
the s

 unclassified example acoustooptic spectrometer  gflops equivalent
 for  watts doing continuous ffts  launched in  on a year
 mission submillimeter wave observatory

not ffts  fts  fourier transforms  all you need for
taking a d fourier transform is a lens  its undergrad
physicslab stuff  i get  hits from
  httpwwwgooglecomsearchqfourieroptics

 of course the rest of the talk is about the promise of moving from
 optoelectronic to alloptical processors on alloptical nets  with
 optical encryption  so on

all optical  no optoelectronics anywhere
thats medicinalgrade pure snake oil usp

photons are well known for not interacting with
each other  its hard to do computing without
interactions
