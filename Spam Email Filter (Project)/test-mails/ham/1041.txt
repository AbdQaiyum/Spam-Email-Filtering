 it may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
 there all along

grin  thats what the past  or  months of exmh hacking has been all about 
for me

ive now stabilized everything pretty well for my paid job so ill probably 
poke around at the sequences performance issues but rather than checking 
changes in ill email anything i figure out since im leaving town in less 
than  hours
