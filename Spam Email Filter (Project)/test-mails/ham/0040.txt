thanks paul
that is the way i am doing right now but i would like to not use the mouse 
for such things any other clue

the best i can think of is to figure out what the command being 
issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
key sequence  that shouldnt be too difficult its just a matter 
of figuring out the tcl something my perlbased brain isnt excited 
about

paul

	it may look like im just sitting here doing nothing
   but im really actively waiting for all my problems to go away

	 if youre not having fun youre not doing it right
