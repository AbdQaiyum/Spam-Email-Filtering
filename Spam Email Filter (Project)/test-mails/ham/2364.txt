rob pringles can flickenger and others cliff skolnik at the oreilly os x con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here  every  or  seconds you start getting connection refused messages 
from your browser and other netutilities rob pringles can flickenger wrote 
it up 

it turns out that running the great networkspy app etherpeg or other 
promiscuous network sniffers and the builtin firewall in os x at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a rejected message 

so today rob and everyone else who knows about this is going to run around 
and tell people running etherpeg to turn off the firewall and viceversa 
ah fickle networking you are such a stern mistress link discuss 
thanks rob
