secure and at ease

max levchins fascination with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in kiev ukraine and continued as he immigrated to the united states 
where he attended the university of illinois at urbanachampaign in 
late  not two years out of college he drew on his passion to 
cofound paypal the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier internet 
transaction processor now online auction house ebay has acquired his 
company for a kings ransom

not bad for a yearold kid from ukraine

a programmer since he was  years old levchin and his family moved to 
chicago in  and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission he created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for palm pilots he met peter thiel and the two founded 
paypal to target online payment security thiel is now ceo of the 
company

this company was founded on the notion of security value levchin 
says peter thiel and i shared that vision from the very beginning

thiel concentrates on company business matters whereas levchin remains 
focused on security which he says is the key to the companys good 
fortune

i explain paypal as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor levchin says we spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesnt step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around 
the tradeoff is fundamental

mountain view califbased paypal allows businesses and consumers with 
email addresses to send and receive payments via the internet 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases the 
service extends to  countries with more than  million users and 
more than  million business accounts

most of paypals users are participants in online auctions which led 
paypal to be closely linked with ebay the leading web auction site 
although they were once rivals the relationship between the two 
companies resulted july  in ebays tentative  billion acquisition 
of paypal the agreement is subject to regulatory review

levchin says he will stay at paypal as it merges with ebay there are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore

although security is a dominant feature for paypal the companys 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing web services model levchin says

this is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another he says levchin is a panelist at infoworlds 
nextgeneration web services ii conference sept 

paypal as an online payment system is a natural target for fraud and 
levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system says avivah litan a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at stamford connbased gartner

if they didnt have max they might have succumbed because paypal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering and max tightened them up 
litan says

to combat criminals levchin established igor an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes the 
work i do is important to paypal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes internet shopping safe its the view that ecommerce has 
arrived
