folks 

some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue server
there are three catalogue only servers running now and honor is acting
as a nomination only server tonight we will be completely turning off
catalogue support on honor so if you are specifying honor with the rs
option please take it out and let the agents discover a closeby
catalogue server

cheers
