amazing story about the dabba wallahs  indias yearold mealdelivery 
system that outdoes fedex using pictograms bicycles and largely illiterate 
but wellcompensated deliverypeople 

    as part of the tiffin distribution process every day the meals are picked 
    up from commuters homes in mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
    work delivered to them on time then picked up and delivered home before 
    the commuters return 

    each tiffin carrier has painted on its top a number of symbols that 
    identify where the carrier was picked up the originating and destination 
    stations and the address to which it is to be delivered 

    after the tiffin carriers are picked up they are taken to the nearest 
    railway station where they are sorted according to the destination 
    station 

    at the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
    resorted this time according to street address and floor 

    the  kg crates of carriers carried on dabba wallahs heads handwagons 
    and cycles are delivered at  pm picked up at  pm and 
    returned when they came 

    the system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs and a single tiffin 
    box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
    office
