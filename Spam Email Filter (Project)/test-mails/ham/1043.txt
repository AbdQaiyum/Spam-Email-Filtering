    so ill probably poke around at the sequences performance issues
 
 well theres this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand 
 
      hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that dont exist
     foreach m rseq 
         if file exists mhprofilepathfolderm 
             exmhdebug mhprofilepathfolderm not found
             set ix lsearch seq m
             set seq lreplace seq ix ix
          else 
              real hack
             break
         
     
 
 which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
 of messages that dont exist   im not sure why it is important that the
 first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any
 of the others but im sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots
 and i dont know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the
 sequences it is looking at all the time

although my fingerprints are all over that its not actually my code and has 
been in there since before   its code that i moved from mhtcl to 
sequencestcl and back again  im no sure either but it should be a 
onetime penalty because the sequence will be rewritten with the bad messages 
removed  i think

 it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
 folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
 directory   does tcl have a directory read function   i assume so
 
 mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the
 context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called

that was a problem but if you look at mhsequence and mhsequences and 
mhsequenceupdate they all call mhreadseqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched  look for the 
exmhdebug reading filename output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk


my theory is that ftocshowsequences is being called too often  im about to 
investigate that

    ill email anything i figure out since im leaving town in less 
    than  hours
 
 have a good vacation

thanks

chris
