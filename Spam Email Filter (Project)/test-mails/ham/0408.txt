 c is more reliable than java


both are reliable  reliability is more a function of the software
engineer  ive written complicated missioncritical server software in
java that will run without a hiccup as long as the unix box it is
sitting on is running  same with c  for processes that are running
months at a time and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of lowlevel network stuff reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem and problems you didnt conceive of recovers
to a cleansafe process state so that things keep running ie it is a
designprogramming issue

that said we usually prototype serious systems in java and then
reimplement them in c if we have time  java doesnt scale well as a
language for server apps though not for the reasons usually offered 
the problem is that for highend server apps you really need fairly
detailed and lowlevel control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that dont give
you access to it  you can squeeze several times the performance out of
a c server program than a java one simply by being able to finely tune
or more frequently bypass the system resource management 
nonetheless this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language as most arent limited by
raw performance scalability
