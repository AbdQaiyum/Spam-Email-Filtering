 what do you mean by cdkey or the like i presume that of was a
 typo and what do you mean by unbreakable

of was a typo

unbreakable would mean here that no one even previously authorised entity 
could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee

 you need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
 solve and about the constraints involved

it could be an online system that work  offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server  no mass production cds maybe mass personalised dl like sun 
jdk

nothing is fixed yet we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation  

is the use of trusted hardware really worth it   does it really make it 
more secure   look at the dvds
