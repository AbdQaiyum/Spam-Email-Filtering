guido on the classifier pickle on sf
 i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything
 systematic

cool

 it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa

ditto

 but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
 mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope
 geeks list that happened to be using mime andor html

do you know why  the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime
independent of html  for example the spamprob of contenttypetextplain
in that pickle is under   contenttypemultipartalternative gets
 but thats not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more
than cancel it out

wrt hating html possibilities include

 it really had to do with something other than mimehtml

 these are pure html not multipartalternative with a textplain part
   so that the tags arent getting stripped  the pickled classifier
   despises all hints of html due to its clpy heritage

 these are multipartalternative with a textplain part but the
   latter doesnt contain the same text as the texthtml part for
   example as anthony reported perhaps the textplain part just
   says something like this is an hmtl message

if its  it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize
meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway  in fact id like
to do that and default it to true  the extreme hatred of html on tech lists
strikes me as umm extreme wink

 so i guess ill have to retrain it yes you told me so 

that would be a different experiment  im certainly curious to see whether
jeremys muchworsethanmine error rates are typical or aberrant
