  but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
  mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope
  geeks list that happened to be using mime andor html
 
 do you know why  the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime
 independent of html  for example the spamprob of contenttypetextplain
 in that pickle is under   contenttypemultipartalternative gets
  but thats not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more
 than cancel it out

i reran the experiment with the new spamhampik but it doesnt seem
to make a difference  here are the clues for the two spams in my
inbox in hammiepys output format which sorts the clues by
probability the first two numbers are the message number and overall
probability then linefolded

this has  contenttypes as spam clues only one of which is related
to html despite there being an html alternative and  other spam
clues vs only  ham clues  this was an announcement of a public
event by our building owners with a text part that was the same as
the html afaict  its language may be spammish but the contenttype
clues didnt help  btw it makes me wonder about the wisdom of
keeping punctuation  economy and economy to me dont seem to
deserve two be counted as clues

ive been looking into hotels  i poked around expedia for availability
from march  to   nights wednesday thorugh saturday  

ive also started contacting hotels for group rates some of the group
rates are no better than the regular rates and they require signing a
contract with a minimum number of rooms sold with someone financially
responsible for unbooked rooms  most hotels are less than responsive

	radission  barcelo hotel dupont circle
	night weekend

	state plaza hotel foggy bottom near gwu
	night weekend

	hilton silver spring near metro in suburban md
	hight weekend

	windsor park hotel
	conn ave between dupont circlewoodley park metro stations
	night needs a car

	econo lodge alexandria near metro in suburban va
	night

this is a hand picked list i ignored anything over night even
though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates
also im not sure how much these prices reflect an expediaonly
discount  i cant vouch for any of these hotels either

i also found out that the down season for dc hotels are midjune through
midseptember and midnovember through midjanuary

z


this one has no mime structure nor html  it even has a
contentdisposition which is counted as a nonspam clue  it got
fped because of the many hospitalityrelated and moneyrelated
terms  im surprised night and similar arent clues too  and
again several spam clues are duplicated with different variations
hotel hotels hotels subjecthotel rates rates

 wrt hating html possibilities include
 
  it really had to do with something other than mimehtml
 
  these are pure html not multipartalternative with a textplain part
    so that the tags arent getting stripped  the pickled classifier
    despises all hints of html due to its clpy heritage
 
  these are multipartalternative with a textplain part but the
    latter doesnt contain the same text as the texthtml part for
    example as anthony reported perhaps the textplain part just
    says something like this is an hmtl message
 
 if its  it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize
 meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway  in fact id like
 to do that and default it to true  the extreme hatred of html on tech lists
 strikes me as umm extreme wink

i also looked in more detail at some fps in my geeks traffic  the
first ones a doozie thats the term right   it has lots of
html clues that are apparently ignored  it was a multipartmixed with
two parts a brief textplain part containing one or two sentences a
mondo weird url

httpxdejacomstrnpsgetdocxpancontexthitnum

and some employergenerated spammish boilerplate the second part was
the html taken directly from the above url  clues

the second fp had the same structure and sender  the third fp
had the same structure and a different sender  ditto the fifth sixth  not posting clues for
brevity

the fourth was different plaintext with one very short sentence and a
url  clues

the seventh was similar

i scanned a bunch more until i got bored and most of them were either
of the first form brief text with url followed by quoted html from
website or the second brief text with one or more urls

its up to you to decide what to call this but i think these are none
of your   or  theyre close to  but all are multipartmixed
rather than multipartalternative

  so i guess ill have to retrain it yes you told me so 
 
 that would be a different experiment  im certainly curious to see whether
 jeremys muchworsethanmine error rates are typical or aberrant

its possible that the corpus youve trained on is more homogeneous
than you thought
