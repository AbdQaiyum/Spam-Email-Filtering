i am delurking to comment on the salon article i just wanted to say that i am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought i sent it in a couple of days before the  commeration if i had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on  my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged however i watch the frontline show faith and doubt at ground zero on pbs that show tackled head on with much more courage than i have seen elsewhere the larger questions about good and evil about art as an alternate religion karlheinz stockhausen   was a great work of art and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the nonbelievers
i am not a religious person but i stunned at the scope of this program it talked about the lutheran minister who spoke at yankees stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal presumably the lutherans have the one true path
thanks for listening i just felt like i needed to put the word out about this program my shallow comment on salon and others like it my boyfriend and i had sex while the towers collapsed gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others
