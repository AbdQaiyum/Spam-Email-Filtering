 i am planning to get istream solo and share it across a small network
 wireless but i dont want to have to pay eircom for a router and having a
 noisy pc running constantly isnt really an option because at home
 inevitably someone will unplug it
 
 i have been looking at a number of products and although i read the thread
 about eircom needing pppoe last august i am still not sure if the one that i
 am interested in will do the job it is a hawking technology ar 
  httpwwwhawkingtechcomproductsarhtm  and if it does the job it
 will actually be cheaper than the modem eircom is selling
 
 i would really appreciate if someone could look at the spec on the hawking
 web page and give me an opinion
 
 thanks in advance

i got the dslw e from httpwwwdslwarehousecouk

though its not at all the best one around i have to say it does the job
and a bit some of the features can be a pain to get working ie pptp in
pppoe mode  cant figure it out the documentation is not the best but
the guys from httpwwwdslwarehousecouk will help you ouit they
also have a message board

the command line interface is quite powerful but absolutely not
userfriendly

all in all its a cheap desent performer that i am happy enough with
got this one including a microfilter not needed for euro including
shipping better than any deal from eircom
