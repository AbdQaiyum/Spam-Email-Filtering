  the perlmodule mailcheckuser implements a smtpcallback and i hope
  it might be integrated rather easily
  has this extension been discussed before and perhaps rejected
  or perhaps someone is already planning to implement it
  or would you be interested to integrate a smtpcallbackpatch in
  spamassassin if contributed by my department we would not be to happy
  about such a patch which we had to manage and integrate with sa in the
  future but i believe a onetime contribution would be no problem

 howd this deal with you running sa on an account where all the mail from some
domain on another server ends up
