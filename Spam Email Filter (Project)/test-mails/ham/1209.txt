 i just updated to the latest cvs  i had been running a build from june  
 hitting the flist button gives the following traceback
 
 syntax error in expression int
     while executing

 it seems to only happen in a folder with no unseen messages
 
 chris is this related to your recent changes

curious  i changed the arguments to ftocshowsequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument  somehow your version 
of scanfolder is still trying to pass f  you seem to have the latest 
ftoctcl  but not the latest scantcl 

i dont know how that happened but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date
