  also theres some stuff about french consumer law forbidding sale
  without guarantee of anything so software delivered asis
  breaches consumer law in france but i didnt really follow that
 
 my french is a bit iffy these days but if this is true does it not also
 nullify microsoft adobe and winzip licences amongst most others these all
 claim no liability no guarantees m say delivered with all faults so
 at least they are honest

apparently the angle on this ie selling without guarantee is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed  at
least thats what i remember reading about how m gets away with providing
no guarantee in the us if youre feeling rather deep pocketed you could
always try suing m to get a courts view on the matter
