  i cvsed the unseensequences changes and installed them and have only one 
  real issue
  
  i use the unseen window rather than the exmh icon and with the new code
  i cant seem to be able to  how many unseen when when i have the main window open
  is not really necessary
 
 hmmm i stole the code from unseenwin but i never tested it since i dont use 
 that functionality  consider it on my list of things to check

well unfortunately i appear to be using a window manager that doesnt 
support the icon window

however i did fix some bugs in the related hide when empty functionality 
which may solve the issue  you may need to remove unseen from the always 
show sequences to make this work  if so let me know so i can put that in 
the help window for icon window as it already is for hide when empty
