 actually i want to avoid that  ive already removed spamproxyd
 from the distro for  heres why
 
 when theyre in the distro we have to support them  which is
 not necessarily a good thing when we didnt write them in the first
 place or when the coder in question may not want us to maintain
 them 

i would be in favor of creating new spamassassin cvs modules and
bugzilla categories for other clients provided there is sufficient
interest and a maintainer
