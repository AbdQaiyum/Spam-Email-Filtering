 there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are
 planning on making money from the spam  what a court would consider
 evidence of being the spammer is another question

haha

just a few notes

  it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone
   in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a
   good example even if they do officially respect copyright law

  law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court
   case we could have years of spam in our mail boxes

  contact information can change phone numbers po boxes stolen
   cell phones temporary email addresses etc

  spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i
   dont understand it either but nobody said they were bright  also
   some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example
   pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way
