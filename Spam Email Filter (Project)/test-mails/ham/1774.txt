 takers  how is esrs bogofilter packaged  spamassassin  the perl
 bayes filter advertised on slashdot

wrt the last its a small pile of windows exe files along with
cygwindll  the exes are cmdline programs  one is a pop proxy  if i
currently have an email server named say mailcomcastnet with user name
timmy then i change my email reader to say that my server is  and
that my user name on that server is mailcomcastnettimmy  in that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is

this is an nway classifier like ifile that way and all it does is
insert a

    xtextclassification  oneoftheclassnamesyoupicked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader  the user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and do
something about it and even outlook can handle that much wink

the user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier
