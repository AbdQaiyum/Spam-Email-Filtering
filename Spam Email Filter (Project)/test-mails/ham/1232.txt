i have a couple of small issues and im not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues

first when i try and run exmh with wish from tk it seems to take
forever to start but with wish from tka it starts in a snap

using the latest cvs when i open exmh and the folder im in has unseen
messages and i hit next exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder

finally when i reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen exmh always goes back to inbox which has no unseen
messages rather than the next folder with unseen messages  when i 
goto next from inbox it does go where i would think it should go

just wanted to let you know what im seeing and find out if im expecting
some different than i should be

thanks for all the effort
