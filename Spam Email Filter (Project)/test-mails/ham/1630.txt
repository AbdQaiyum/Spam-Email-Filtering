i have been trying to research via sa mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their userprefs options via a
webbased cgi interface numerous isps provide this feature to clients but
so far i can find nothing our configuration uses amavispostfix and clamav
for virus filtering and procmail with spamassassin for spam filtering i
would prefer not to have to write a script myself but will appreciate any
suggestions
