just as the pyramids of egypt were built in honour of great kings it was
fitting that sandy replicas were created on weymouth beach in memory of the
king of the castle fred darrington who became the worlds most famous
sand
sculptor died last week aged  his grandson mark anderson who has
taken
over his dorset seafront pitch is determined that his grandfathers name
will
not be forgotten despite the impermanence of his creations

can someone please tell me what a pitch constitutes i have an idea 
it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim but this sounds 
more formal

just an area of the beach by the prom where hes allowed to make his
sculptures
weymouth is where i spent my teenage years my mum and one sister still live
there
so im pretty familiar with the sculptures pretty impressive and very big
i think he uses some sort of armature for some bits  its not just sand
they usually get vandalised though after a lot of drinks it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits
then again weymouth is pretty run down and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort
