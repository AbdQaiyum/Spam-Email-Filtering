btw ive been thinking a little about the rpms and other packages
already the pld guys are distributing  rpms

   perlmailspamassassin

          the perl modules

   spamassassin

          the spamassassin and spamd scripts
          spamd rcfile etc

   spamassassintools

          masscheck masses directory stuff etc
          for generating rescore data from corpora

this seems like a good way to do it this way stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesnt need to require the full rpm be installed
with rc files in initd etc

its been adopted in the distributed spec file anyway

theo btw whats the eval test you add in the tvd version of the rpm
