i think that this and other articles confuse socialism with 
bureaucracy  libertarianism as implemented in north america is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency

just try starting a telephone company in the us or even worse 
canada  it can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
permit rajs at the fcc puc and ptts or in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning canada industry canada and the crtc

yet despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the ftc sec and irs the 
executives of telecom companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars  they 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz  laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down

so tell me again how are we better off

 the mystery of capital why capitalism triumphs in the west and fails
 everywhere else  by hernando de soto	

 is something im reading now

 my impression is that france is not anywhere near the permit raj
 nightmare that india is and became  nor has its market been closed
 like indias has

 but de sotos work is perhaps just as important or more so  he hasnt
 dealt specifically with india but i recall examples from peru
 philippines and egypt  in lima his team took over a year i think it
 was  working  hr days to legally register a  person company  
 in the
 philippines getting legal title can take  years  in egypt 
 about 
 of the population in cairo lives in places where they are officially
 illegal

 india hasnt been helped by its socialism  socialism has certainly
 helped strangle the country in permits  but perhaps de soto is right
 that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the
 legal official property system

 putting most of the people in the property system was something 
 the west
 only finished about  years ago or japan did  years ago  it 
 wasnt
 easy but we live in a society that doesnt even remember we did it

 subject re the curse of indias socialism

 rah quoted
 indians are not poor because there are too many of them they are
 poor
 because there are too many regulations and too much government
 intervention
  even today a decade after reforms were begun indias greatest
 problems
 arise from a political culture guided by socialist instincts on the
 one
 hand and an imbedded legal obligation on the other hand

 nice theory and all but sindiafranceg and the statements hold just
 as true yet france is  in the uns hdi ranking not 


 since all parties must stand for socialism no party espouses
 classical liberalism

 im not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution
 for countries in real difficulty  see joseph stiglitz nobel for
 economics on the fmis failed remedies  of course googling on
 stiglitz fmi only brings up links in spanish and french  i guess
 that variety of spin is non grata in many anglo circles
