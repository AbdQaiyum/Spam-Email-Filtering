finally finished up most of tramp my rdf interface for python if you dont 
use rdf or python you can probably safely skip this entry  

new in this version rdf library abstraction because rdflibs organization 
currently sucks write values in addition to reading and unit tests all with 
that old tramp flavor youve come to know and love  

but wait it also comes with an entire page of explanationadvertisement 
if youre not already convinced



    rdfxml got you down tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data want to write python and be standardscompatible at the same 
    time need a module to implement the psuedocode you had on your slides 
    tramp may or may not be the answer to these problems



enjoy and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me why its called tramp
