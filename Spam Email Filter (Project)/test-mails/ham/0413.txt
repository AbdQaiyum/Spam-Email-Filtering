     and a java program due to the extensive class libraries will
     weigh in at  the number of lines of the equivalent c
     program  qed

    r there are massive amounts of libraries for c fortran and so
    r on  to pick an obvious example if you want to do linear
    r algebra then java isnt a serious candidate at all

if you want to do http c gets pretty muddy curl is about the best
choice ive found but i grant you that no language is the beall and
endall

i envy some of those posting to this list  ive been in business for
 years and i havent yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project we are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere  

as much as i hate dealing with someone elses blackbox as much as
ive spent sleepless nights secondguessing external libs ive never
ever had the luxury to do otherwise it must be wonderful to be
responsible for something you are actually responsible for and i am
so sick of being blamed for other peoples design mistakes

maybe theres an archive somewhere i need to know about but ive been
using c since drdobbs first published smallc and yet ive never found
any decent lgpl libs cataloged in such a way that i can just type in
the task and get back an api  because of javadoc which is by no
means perfect java provides me the second best catalog of rdparty
libs second only to perls cpan  perl is one language i also really
hate with a passion yet end up using the most for exactly this reason

for example take the recent cbc olympics site i needed to roll
together a telnet client with a tokenizer perlregex preprocessing a
stream to produce parseable xml project that xml into relational
databases using only the dtd to generate the rdbms schema and open an
xmlrpc interface to read and post items into the news stream  where
can i find c libs for those components  

on the webserver we then needed a multithreaded readonly http socket
which can spawn persistent datacaching servlets that periodically
refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database
presenting the retreived values through xsltdefined transforms and
again where can i find such stuff for c  or for any other langauge
but java  wombat servlet spec for perl was inviting but its not
ready for primetime and reinventing that entire shopping list in c
is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of  weeks

when you need c libs or even c libs wheres the best place to shop
where do you find standardsbased portable rdbms api odbc how do
you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
trying it out

in a perfect universe id use ocaml or even ruby but i dont see the
social infrastructure for either happening during my professional
lifetime

    r why do so many people outside of suns marketing department
    r consider java to be write once debug everywhere 

a collegue at cognos henk called c the nearlyportable assembler
