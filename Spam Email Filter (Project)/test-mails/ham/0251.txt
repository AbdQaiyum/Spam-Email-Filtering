 hiall
 
 does anyone know how to list the biggest file in my
 root directoryor the second biggest etc
 
 because i want to find out what is the reason cause my
 root all most full

 find dir name    xargs du s  sort n

smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end so if
you want to get the  largest files pipe through tail

eg

 find dir name    xargs du s  sort n  tail
