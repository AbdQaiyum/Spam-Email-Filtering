  i am wondering whether theres a way that i can use sitescooper andor plucker
  or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
  more palmos friendly
 
 	you could try antiword httpwwwwinfielddemonnllinux
 its consoled based and converts word  docs to text and some images to
 postscript and png

also theres catdoc and wv for word  text conversions  actually wv
consists of wvware which as the manpage says converts word documents
into other formats such as ps pdf html latex dvi abw  html would
probably be the best format for use with pluckersitescooper depending
on how good the doc  html conversion is  i havent used either in
over a year as abiword or openoffice work well enough  prefer abiword
for its lightweight size but openoffice has the better doc importer

dont know which of these are better or worse than the other but i
figure the more the merrier 

 you could also try openoffice andor abiword if you
 have x installed

abiword supports exporting to palmdoc pdb which is about as
palmosfriendly as you can get  never triedneeded it but its listed
there in the save as dialog box

wine or crossover office if you already have it may support word
viewer free download from microsoft but didnt a year or so ago when
i last tried  word viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
word  docs to word  as you could display the word  doc and copy 
paste the text with formatting into word  which was the only
version of word that i had  anyways a little nostalgia

  i dont have a windows machine so it becomes problematic to convert them
  i know that if this were not the case in word i could save them as some
  other more friendly format

i have a windows dualboot machine but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multisession cdrrw  is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecords multisession feature  since
openoffice ive been able to edit word docs flawlessly or at least the
simple word documents i receive from others

anyways
