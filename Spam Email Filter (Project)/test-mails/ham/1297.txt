 is it possible to use new apt to do null to rh upgrade

possible  should be it was possible to update to null from rh with 
apt did that on my laptop and well it was painfull to say the least 
including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb dont expect it to be 
an easy distupgrade at any rate so much stuff has changed and apt 
doesnt always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in 
rhl

 
 even if its possible are there good reasons why maybe i should not do
 it and just use the rh isos i dont think rh will upgrade from
 null maybe update will

its possible but not supported by rh ive upgraded both my laptop and my 
home box from null to rh and didnt encounter any issues though
