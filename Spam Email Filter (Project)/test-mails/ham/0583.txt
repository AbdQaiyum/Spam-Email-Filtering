 listen  if you pull numbers like that without a fact the automagic
 assumption is yes they were extracted out of your neither orifice
 point wasnt to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits
 its not my job to do your bit searching for you but i figured id
 humor fork with this bit of finding
 
 httpwwwthebodycombpaprresearchnotebookhtml  pointing ot
 averages of about  for every  months for gay men which totals to
 about   a year   a year doesnt equal    or even 

er that study would seem to lend credence to eugens
estimations rather than casting fresh doubts 

 a year does exceed  in under  years time the average
age of that studys participants was   meaning some 
participants may have had  years of active sex life 

at that age and further  hiv  it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit 

so while this studys summary info is incomplete you could 
easily conclude that the average participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a  year active 
sex life and so the evenmoreactive tails of the distribution
could easily be in the  range

of course this says very little almost nothing about the overall 
population behavior gay or straight and the relative prevalence
of k individuals in either group but it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with k partners exist in measurable numbers so
people should stop treating eugens anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy bitbitchs own citation suggests otherwise
