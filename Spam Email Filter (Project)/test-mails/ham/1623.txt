inspired by complaints about allimage or mostlyimage spam thats
getting by sa ive cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of img tags in html one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message thtmlimagearea one that looks at the
total number of images in the message thtmlnumimgs and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
thtmlconsecimg



the total area of all images is rather easy to compute inside of
htmlhtmltests if an img tag has both the width and height
properties then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total

overall   spam nonspam     so    rank   score  name
                         all messages
                    all messages as 
                        thtmlimagearea
                        thtmlimagearea

spam  of all rules with s   



the total number of img tags is really easy to do

                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                       thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs
                        thtmlnumimgs

spam  of all rules with so   



i figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
have img tags interspersed with table paragraph and linebreak tags
and some whitespace so there would be a lot of img tags with no plain
text nonwhitespace between them  so i defined consecutive img tags
to be ones with no text between them and looked at the longest run of
consecutive imgs within a message

this one seems to do pretty good because in my nonspam corpus
theres only a handful of messages with img runs larger than two

                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
                        thtmlconsecimgs
