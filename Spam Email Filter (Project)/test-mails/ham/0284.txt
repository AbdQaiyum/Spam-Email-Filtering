hi

some time now the following messages were haunting me

     automount attempting to mount entry homedude

it just came to my attention that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up i grepped through the binaries and found referrences to homedude

 grep homedude usrbin
binary file usrbinaaxine matches
binary file usrbingentoo matches
binary file usrbingphoto matches
binary file usrbingtkam matches


i am now relaxed again  and pass this info on probably matthias saou
himself is dude and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory it would be nice to find out which and fix it but i am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down

regards axel
