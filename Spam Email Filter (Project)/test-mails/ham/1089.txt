exmh has a funky cutpaste model that is essentially all my fault
the middle click sets the insert point  if you hate that go to the
bindings simple edit preferences window and deselect
paste sets insert

  i am a tvtwm user when i snarf text into my mouse cut buffer and then
  attempt to inject it into the exmh input windows for comprepl the 
point
  is often an apparently random place in the text pane not where i think i
  have current flashing cursor 
  
  i usually wipe out any of tosubjectrandom body with the text its
  often not even beginning of line denoted ie its an unexplicable number
  of char spaces in to the text where it inserts 
  
  what am i doing wrong in either x wm shell exmh which is causing this
