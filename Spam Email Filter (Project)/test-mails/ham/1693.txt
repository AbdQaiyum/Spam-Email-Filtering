using lm  is yielding an extra  a day but it gets false positives
where it shouldnt

such as an email with a word doc and the signature below  after looking at

signature as spam

so i have to turn off lm   razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldnt with lm  on

      see the incredimail ad signature i am talking about below

      fox
