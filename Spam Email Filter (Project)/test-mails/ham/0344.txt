 ick  perhaps this is why red hat turned the bytecode interpreter off 
 it may improve nonantialiased rendering but only at the expense of 
 making a mess of antialiased rendering
 
 this may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics but for my part 
 im going back to red hats standard packages with the bytecode 
 interpreter turned off
yes confirmed but for my part im using mostly nonantialiased fonts
and 
they are true ugly without the bytecode interpreter enabled

remember my stupid request about your rpm
