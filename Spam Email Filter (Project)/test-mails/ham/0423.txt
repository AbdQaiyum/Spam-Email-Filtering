liters of liquid nitrogen ln c and decided to run some tests in 
very low temperatures

after some adjusting and testing we were able to run sisoft sandra cpu 
and memory benchmarks and pifast benchmark smoothly when the cpu was 
running at mhz we raised the fsb one more step and managed to run 
succesfully superpi benchmark while cpu was running at mhz the 
result was  seconds
