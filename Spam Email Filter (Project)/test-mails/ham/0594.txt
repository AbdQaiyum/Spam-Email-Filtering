 ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all
 dayim sure its some neurochemical process initiated during the dream
 that is still cycling thru  like a deja vu triggered by memory
 processes where  you dont actually remember but you feel like youre
 remembering

absolutely and ive wanted to recapture it  ive done some writing based 
on dreams and there is a mysterious mood to that feeling that drives 
some creative stuff for me  ive never tried to write music in that 
state but i will next time
