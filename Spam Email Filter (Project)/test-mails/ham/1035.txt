you can also duplicate thiswith

msgchange  noshow

at the tcl prompt in the log window  i suspect that the sequence
parser which understands things like  to mean messages  through 
is confused when asked to addremove message  from a sequence

if we are allowed to assume  or higher which we cant really then
we could add

if string is integer selectsel 
    bail out of message select mode

to the selecttypein procedure

we can probably survive with

if regexp  selectsel 
    bail out of message select mode

     tell me what keystroke made it happen so i can reproduce it and ill
     see what i can do about it or if i cant ill hand it off to 
brent
  
  dont worry too much about it you seem to have plenty of other things
  to do in the immediate future and this one isnt so critical that people
  cant use the code in normal ways
  
  but to make it happen type with normal key bindings any digit so the
  code thinks youre trying a message number then backspace so the digit
  goes away then  other junk characters dont seem to have the
  problem i have just been playing   that will do it every time
  
  that is  h 
  
  once you get into that state the same traceback occurs for every
  character you type until a message is selected with the mouse
  
  this is looking like it might be easy to find and fix so ill take a
  look at it later
