 hi
 
 is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not
 to have sent the mail to insert it then

i simply put it them into my nmh component files components
replcomps forwcomps and so on  that way you get them when you are
editing your message  also by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your sig per folder and other tricks  see
the docs for nmh for all the details

there might must also be a way to get sedit to do it but ive
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now  i
load it with a command that loads some emailspecific settings eg
to syntax colourhighlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email it would be possible to map some vim keys that would add
a sig or even give a selection of sigs to choose from

and there are all sorts of ways to have randomlychosen sigs
somewhere at rtfmmitedu ok here we go
rtfmmitedupubusenetbygroupnewsanswerssignaturefingerfaq
warning its old may

 ulises

hope this helps
