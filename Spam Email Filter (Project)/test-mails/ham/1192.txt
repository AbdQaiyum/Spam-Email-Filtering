hi

just the kind of announce i make once in a while 
 ive rebuilt a new alsaplayer package based on angles one
 ive rebuilt a hopefully final version fr of the alsadriver and
  alsakernel packages which fix all known smp build issues

both can be found here 
httpftpfreshrpmsnetpubfreshrpmstestingalsa

ive also repackaged gkrellm  with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesnt even require glib
httpftpfreshrpmsnetpubfreshrpmstestinggkrellm

last but not least my latest proftpd  package incorporates some nifty
new features  you can use any of with ldap with mysql and with
postgres when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly and the release tag is changed too
httpvalhallafreshrpmsnet the usual place 

i think ill use this with whatever switch more and more where
possible some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable pilot support

as usual feedback and comments are welcome
