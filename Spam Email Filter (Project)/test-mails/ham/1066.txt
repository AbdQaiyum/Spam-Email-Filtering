   sh c for f in folders recurse fast  do sortm f  done

 thanks tom and jacob the above works but without the double quotes ie

 sh c for f in folders recurse fast  do sortm f  done

i may have a different version of sh than you do the double quotes
around the backticks work for my sh

in the morethanyoureallywantedtoknow category youre probably
safe without the double quotes  the only reason i put them in is that
i have some pathologicallynamed folders including folders whose
names contain spaces  if all your folders have safe names you dont
need special quoting
