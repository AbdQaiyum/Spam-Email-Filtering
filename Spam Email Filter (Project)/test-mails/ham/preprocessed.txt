   i cant reproduce this error

for me it is very repeatable like every time without fail

this is the debug log of the pick happening 

 pickit exec pick inbox list lbrace lbrace subject ftp rbrace rbrace  sequence mercury
 exec pick inbox list lbrace lbrace subject ftp rbrace rbrace  sequence mercury
 ftocpickmsgs  hit
 marking  hits
 tkerror syntax error in expression int 

note if i run the pick command by hand 

delta pick inbox list lbrace lbrace subject ftp rbrace rbrace   sequence mercury
 hit

thats where the  hit comes from obviously  the version of nmh im
using is 

delta pick version
pick  nmh compiled on fuchsiacsmuozau at sun mar   ict 

and the relevant part of my mhprofile 

delta mhparam pick
seq sel list


since the pick command works the sequence actually both of them the
one thats explicit on the command line from the search popup and the
one that comes from mhprofile do get created

kre

ps this is still using the version of the code form a day ago i havent
been able to reach the cvs repository today local routing issue i think
