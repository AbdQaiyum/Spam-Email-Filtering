 there are two open alternatives that i can think of
 that dont appear to have been mentioned 
 elsewhere in this thread
 
 
 one is firebird this is my personal favourite
 it is httpfirebirdsqlorg and you can
 purchase support contracts here
 wwwibphoenixcom

indeedy  i had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it  so we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow  it is fast  comes with some lovely client tools
also  supports all the db goodies transactions stored procedures
triggers

 its really amazing to think how much theyve got
 out of a db that is only  mb in size  thats 
 times smaller than the oracle client
 
 
 having said all of the above oracle is really
 a super product but ya pays ya money
 
ibms db is another cheaper alternative to oracle  free single
developer license downloadable from their website
