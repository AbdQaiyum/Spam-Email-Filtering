i propose they rename it charlie heston high and maybe the students  
will learn to take ars with extended militaryspec scopes and   
highvelocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
the suburbs of washington  thats far more effectual than blowing  
oneself up in a bus

in america these days it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
doctrine foreign to bushism is vile and repugnant  but random violence  
is entertainment and intrigue

a couple of exfbi consultants speaking on the shootings in dc were  
quoted as saying the shooters presumed to be a pair were getting a  
heroinlike high from each successful kill and that they for  
whatever reason decided to level the playing field thumbing their nose  
at law enforcement and society

see  just a couple of kids having fun with daddys semiautomatic  
hunting rifle  harmless

 it wasnt gloating it was one for the horror file

 and of course for the palestinians it wasnt a mistake which is a key
 part of the horror

 im not against american taxpayers remodeling a school honoring a  
 killer
 if we do it with a daisy cutter
