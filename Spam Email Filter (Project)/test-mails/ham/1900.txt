briandfoy writes a long time ago don marti started the os
sucksrulesometer and jon orwant wrote his own sucksrulesometer for
computer languages recently dan brian improved on that with a little bit
of natural language processing now the perl review makes pretty
pictures of it all based on searches of altavista and google we found
that not a lot of people think php or lisp sucks a lot think c and
java suck and they put perl is somewhere in the middle does perl suck
more than it use to suck or has php just shot way ahead
