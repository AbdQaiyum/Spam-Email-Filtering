    httpwwwboquistnetstortsupbrev
 
 it seems to hang memory usage goes up to mb and stays there i have
 let it run for an hour before i killed it this was on a
 pentiumii yes i know a bit slow but still
 
 can anyone else confirm this hang maybe i should just upgrade

dont run sa on mails this large most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about k in spamassassin processing because it just kills 
performance there are some known issues with the parsing such as the 
html parsing stuff which is much improved in  which were soon to 
release but nothing thats too likely to be fixed by  perhaps in 
 though
