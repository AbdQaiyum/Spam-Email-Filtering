    e absolutely and ive wanted to recapture it  

i dont know about this particular mood but i have used
neuroconditioning with aiding children in stressful
lifecircumstances

basically you somehow evoke the state you want and when you get it
you do something odd anything at all will do but i used a gentle
vulcan grip on their shoulder  later when faced with the
uncomfortable situation you can retrieve part of that earlier more
desireable state by giving them the pinch its not perfect like you
get with simpler brains but it is an inescapable effect

this is probably the neuroeffect that leads to performanceenhancing
superstitions such as bob dylan not performing without his favourite
jean jacket because it provides the cue to a more relaxed mental
state he really does play better with it than without it
