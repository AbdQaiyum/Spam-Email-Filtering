odud writes rats the rough auditing tool for security is a security
auditing utility for c c python perl and php code rats scans source
code finding potentially dangerous function calls the goal of this
project is not to definitively find bugs the current goal is to provide

produced by secure software uses a database so you can alter what you
want it to look for not a replacement for using stricture or your head
but is a good place to start some security auditing on your perl
