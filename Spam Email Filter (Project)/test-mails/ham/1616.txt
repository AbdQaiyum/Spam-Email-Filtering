 additional comments from spamassassincontribmsquadratde    
 ive thought about this and pmfilter needs to die ive now tried  
 multiple ways to make it just transparently work on  and failed  
 if anyone has any bright ideas please jump in 
  
 you see anyone upgrading from the cpan shell will get a failure on the line 
  
    use extutilsmakemaker  
 
quite some modules from cpan do have a line like this nowadays i think or 
read so somewhere respectively and the perl error message is very clear 
extutilsmakemaker version  requiredthis is only version  at 
makefilepl line  
 
 because it never gets chance to reach a writemakefile line with a  
 prereqpm   extutilsmakemaker    option so the cpan shell  
 cant automatically upgrade this module i cannot think of any way  
 around this 
 
i could think of a solution we could remove the use line and add the 
version to prereqpm after writemakefile we could add the lines 
  require extutilsmakemaker 
  extutilsmakemakerversion 
to do per hand what use extutilsmakemaker  does automagically perl 
makefilepl will die with a uncaught exception from user code 
extutilsmakemaker version  requiredthis is only version  at 
makefilepl line  there but weve got a makefile but i dont know if 
cpan will run the make anyway 
 
 to add insult to injury the pmfilter part gets run during pmtoblib  
 which would be fine except extutilsmakemaker doesnt let you write a  
 mypmtoblib  its nonoverridable so even though we could  
 potentially copy the  extutilsinstallpmtoblib code somewhere  
 into the spamassassin codebase i tried that first we cant cause the  
 makefile to call our code  
 
we could call the preprocessor on install time thats not a very clean 
approach but could work 
 
we can also overwrite pmtoblib in the makefile directly per postamble we 
already have a useless line pmtoblib spamassassin docmade there adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings makefile 
warning overriding commands for target pmtoblib makefile warning 
ignoring old commands for target pmtoblib but does work not a very good 
solution either 
 
 so im strongly against the current use of extutilsmakemaker   
 usage if this were an apache project this would be my veto vote and  
 really hope we can find another way 
 
the use makemaker error message is imho quite clear so i think its ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of extutilsmakemaker before the sa 
installation but thats just my opinion  
 
ill ask on makemakerperlorg for the best solution they should know
