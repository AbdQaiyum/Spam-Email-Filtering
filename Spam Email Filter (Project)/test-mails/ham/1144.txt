make sure you rebuild as root and youre in the directory that you
downloaded the file  also it might complain of a few dependencies but
you can get these at freshrpmsnet except for gcc which you can find
on your red hat cd red hat ftp or rpmfindnet

after you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in
usrsrcredhatrpmsi  with all dependencies met install mplayer
with rpm ivh mplayerfrrpm and you should be good to go

one last thing you will need the win codecs i found them on google
create a directory usrlibwin and place the codecs in there

good luck
