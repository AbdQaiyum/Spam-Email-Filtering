movable type  is out im running it and it appears to work it incorporates 
many suggestions from dive into accessibility a book which was written in 
and is still powered by movable type i find this amusing in a selfreferential 
sort of way 

the other big change is the inclusion of mtsearch to allow users to have their 
own site search every web site needs a site search existing mtsearch 
users should merge the contents of mtsearchcfg into mtcfg change 
templatedir to searchtemplatepath and if you use alternate templates 
change alttemplate alttemplate alttemplate etc to alttemplate 
they should all just be alttemplate
