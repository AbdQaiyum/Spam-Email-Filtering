there are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would at first hearing expect them to napster at heart just irc with a ui 
was one google news is another 

in its first day ive already noticed 

 the front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earths 
terminator is so in the evening on the west coast google news is lead by 
the south china morning post and various asian englishlanguage papers by the 
late evening the bbc and european papers are kicking in 
 the site may be created by algorithms  but what about the choice of sites 
the most arbitrary dividing line i see in googles coverage is what is a news 
site and what isnt slashdot is for instance as well as some very 
obscure newspapers what about blues news or scripting news though 
 big companies spend mucho money paying clipping services that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value very very quickly
