 at the other extreme training on half my hamspam and scoring aginst
 the other half
 
     false positive rate 
     false negative rate 
 
 alas all  of the  clues there are htmlrelated

that begged to try it again but with tokenizeretainpurehtmltags false
the random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here
and i repaired the bug that dropped  ham and  spam on the floor so this
isnt exactly a change difference between runs

ham distribution for all runs

    false positive rate 
    false negative rate 

yay  that may mean that html tags arent really needed in my test data
provided its trained on enough stuff  curiously the sole false positive
here is the same as the sole false positive on the halfhalf run reported in
the preceding msg i assume the nigerian scam false positive just happened
to end up in the training data both times

there are still two html clues remaining there nbsp and
contenttypetexthtml  anthonys trick accounts for almost a third of
these  python appears in  of them httppython means that python
was found in the st field of an embedded http url  sticking a gif or
a jpg in  a url both score as  spam clues  note the damning pattern of
capitalization in headermimeversion  this counting is casesensitive
and nobody ever would have guessed that mime is more damning than subject or
date  why would spam be likely to end up with two instances of returnpath
in the headers
