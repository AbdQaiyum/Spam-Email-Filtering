 just a few notes

   it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone
    in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a
    good example even if they do officially respect copyright law


a lot of spam which appears to originate from china and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there is sent by and is 
done for the benefit of companies based in the us  the spam 
often appears to originate there because its coming from open 
http or squid proxy servers  its hosted there because these 
spammers are now personanongrata on all us isps  one hardly 
needs to involve the chinese government in a case where a us 
citizen is violating us law


   law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court
    case we could have years of spam in our mail boxes

the first court cases were actually concluded years ago these 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of isps to block mail and to terminate service to 
spammers

   contact information can change phone numbers po boxes stolen
    cell phones temporary email addresses etc

surprising then how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of longtime spammers like alan ralksy of 
detroit michigan  ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media  if you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him his street address is well known ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an antispam law 
thomas cowles is another longtime spammer but last i heard 
hed been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner eddy marin also a long time spammer youve 
heard of poplaunch right

   spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i
    dont understand it either but nobody said they were bright  also
    some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example
    pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly
    required for the spammer to get their way

back when i was working at maps there was a flap over a 
pumpanddump spammer rodona garst  seems she had an open 
fileshare on her laptop and when she forged the wrong domain 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website oh look its still there including the nude 
photos

i recall this well because the sec was very interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online  there 
were some interesting conversations this summer the sec 
released the following

yes the investigation took two years but the financial penalty 
for operating a pumpanddump scam isnt small  the wheels of 
government grind slow but the grind very fine indeed
