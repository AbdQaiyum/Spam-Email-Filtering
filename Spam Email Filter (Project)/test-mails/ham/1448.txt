 i may be dense but why would anyone want to utilize habeus  to
 me it looks like a potential backdoor to anyones defenses against spam

youre not dense im going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
spamassassin i think they were added to sa quite prematurely to me its
simple

 people who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
habeas at least until it gets lots more press and even then only
bulkmailing companies like amazon or ebay are going to bother and i
already whitelist them individuals wont bother

 spammers have lots of motivation to forge the habeas headers and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of habeas

i think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule when i test against my corpus heres what i get

overall     spam  nonspam     so   score  name
                      all messages
                               habeasswe

the score of  is pretty harmless right now but it still looks like a
useless rule so far
