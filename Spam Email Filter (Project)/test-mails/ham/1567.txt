 as i understand it dns a records are used in a rotating fashion for load
 balancing but dns mx records are used in order or prority meaning the 
 before the  and only  if the  isnt available

thats the theory yes

 but only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
 believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 
 never goes down why have i got something confused here

no but either due to some technical glitch or downright just wanting
to do so people send to the secondary  its a semiusual spammer trick
actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary
since it will either have less filtering or be trusted or 

mx records in the mail world are all explained in rfc  section 


   multiple mx records contain a preference indication that must be used
   in sorting see below  lower numbers are more preferred than higher
   ones  if there are multiple destinations with the same preference
   and there is no clear reason to favor one eg by recognition of an
   easilyreached address then the sendersmtp must randomize them to
   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific
   organization

   if it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting
   the address it must sort the mx records to determine candidates for
   delivery  the records are first ordered by preference with the
   lowestnumbered records being most preferred  the relay host must
   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it
   might be known in mail transactions  if a matching record is found
   all records at that preference level and highernumbered ones must be
   discarded from consideration  if there are no records left at that
   point it is an error condition and the message must be returned as
   undeliverable  if records do remain they should be tried best
   preference first as described above
