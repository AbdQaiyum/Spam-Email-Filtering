   c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
 management over and over again  imho java is superior because the problem
 of programming in the future is not about s and s making the compiler
  faster or making your code take  less memory its about design
 patterns architecture high level stuff

considering  of the fake job posting i see are for embedded systems or
device drivers  c still rules the world

   java is not just a programming language its also a platform there
 is nothing like the standard apis in java in c and c  everyone defines
 their own apis people end up solving the same problems ten different ways

the problem is the problem youre trying to solve is never the same java
will soon suffer apirot alot of poeple are already complaining about it
its just new c was clean in the beginning too apirot is purely a
function of age

   if you have a program of any type of high complexity written in c you
 cant possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
 the same magnitude of cost as java

i do this all the time its alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all java does remove the clue requirement tho
just adds a huge testing requirement qa guys arent as cheap 

   makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
 person java imho reduces the dependence of these entities on the
 individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer java as it is
 to reverse engineer c large applications

no its not but you can hire teams of javites for cheap at your local high
school java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming  and its
working
