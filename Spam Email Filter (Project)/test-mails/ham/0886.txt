 from owen byrne owenpermafrostnet
 a flippant remark that i will probably regret  
 sure theres assholes everywhere i just remember a lunch in spain with
 a semifamous american  i think we had about  nationalities at the
 table and he managed to insult each of them within
  minutes a historical perspective makes me think that empires 
 roman british russian american whatever  produce
  a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations and are more
 likely to have them in positions of authority

yep those that win battles collect tthe spoils  lead and breed  want it to be
different  lead dont whine
