all of these af are related to avifile support 
normally my fr build of transcode defaults to not use avifile
but you can use with avifile to force recompiling against it

do you have an old avifile installed maybe
can you check the configure  line run at the beginning of the
rebuild process to see if it does include the withoutavifile option
