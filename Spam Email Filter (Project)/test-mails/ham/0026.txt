 in a nutshell  solaris is suns own flavour of unix

 though im sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail

 solaris is quite different to linux though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra cd of gnu tools sun ship with
solaris it is based on the sysv unix family so its quite similar to
other unixen like hpux and sco

 suns hardware in general is more reliable and a lot more expensive one
of the main bonuses you get by buying sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company so if you have a support contract
they have to fix it they cant fob you off with thats a software
problem talk to the software vendor etc

 if you are set on linux you most likely can do your own support there
is then a world of different hardware options you can run linux on sparc
though some companies like redhat dont maintain a sparc port anymore

 you can also buy your machine from linuxoriented companies like dnuk
who do machines designed to run linux and their own version of linux
that has a few extras for their machines or you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like dell and itll most likely work most of the time
