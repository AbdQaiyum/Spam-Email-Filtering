do we have any statistics on the poor mans divorce from centuries past

eugen leitl
thats easy divorce didnt happen

you seem not to know what a poor mans divorce is
it is an old term from the time when divorce was
difficult but walking was easy and identity was
not so locked down as it is today not every widow
had a dead husband

im seeing lack of innovation 

that doesnt tell us anything except what is
happening in eugen leitls life the more common
observation is that the rate of change is increasing
do you have any data that might persuade us that what
you see is more telling than what others see

gerontocracy favors gerontocracy

i would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes
note that the fertility rate doesnt result from
decisions made by the old but by the young if we
want more kids we have to convince people who are
in their twenties to become parents
