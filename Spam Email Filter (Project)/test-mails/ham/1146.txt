  i dld gcc and libgcc but i still get the same error message when i 
 try rpm rebuild or recompile i do this as root i dld as root also
 
 thanks for the help any more idea whats going on

ive never installed source rpms with apt but i suppose that if you get
file not found its because the source rpm was installed to see if this
is the case go to usrsrcredhatspecs and if you see mplayerspec
youll just need to do rpm bb mplayerspec to get a binary build in
usrsrcredhatrpmsi
