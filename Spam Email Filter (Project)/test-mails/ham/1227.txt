   i vote for this being added to cvs any objections

no but using pickmarkseen and pickids as an alternative to
just doing

seems unnecessary to me thats all that pickmarkseen does after all
that can be done via busy

of course the same is true of the badly named pickmarkseen which has
nothing at all to do with pick except that it abuses the pickids var
in the same way   its name would be hard to change unfortunately as it
is known in appdefaults files for the catch up unseen menu item but
its implementation could certainly be fixed
