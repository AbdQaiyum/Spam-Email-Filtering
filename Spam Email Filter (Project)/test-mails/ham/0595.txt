  ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all
  dayim sure its some neurochemical process initiated during the dream
  that is still cycling thru  like a deja vu triggered by memory
  processes where  you dont actually remember but you feel like youre

 absolutely and ive wanted to recapture it  ive done some writing based 
 on dreams and there is a mysterious mood to that feeling that drives 
 some creative stuff for me  ive never tried to write music in that 
 state but i will next time
