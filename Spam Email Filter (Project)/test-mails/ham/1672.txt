forgive me for being a partially stupid enduser of this fantastic
spam fighting software

i was looking at my spamd debug output today and noticed that it ran
through razor stuff and then it ran through dccproc and then it tried to
go through old razor stuff  im assuming and please correct me if im
wrong that razor is out dated and was to be replaced entirely by razor

if thats the case can someone please point me to something that explains
how to remove razor from my system  i dont see a point in envoking it
especially when it appears to error out on me

debug razor is available
debug entering helperapp run mode
debug razor agents  protocol version 
debug  seconds before closest server discovery
debug agent terminated
problem while trying to load razor permission denied  at
usrlocallibperlsiteperlmailspamassassindnspm line 
debug leaving helperapp run mode

thanks
