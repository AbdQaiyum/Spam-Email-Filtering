 id like to aks this on the rpmzzzlist  would a new dependency of k the
 alsalib package for many packages mplayer ogle xine be a problem for
 the freshrpmsnet packages users as i really feel like blending alsa in
 now especially since ive just spent some time recompiling alsakernel
 package for all the psyche kernels

i dont know a lot about alsa but use custom kernels for many of the 
machines  would this mean in order to get mplayer eg to work id 
first have to compile a custom kernel option or kernel module since i 
wouldnt have your alsakernel installed would that mean alsalibs 
and so on wont install

i guess in short if it requires the shipped kernel to be used id 
be against withalsa as a default
