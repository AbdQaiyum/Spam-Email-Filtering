 well ive used the checkthemodifytime cache trick for files in
 many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it
 is effective  however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
 state then arent we modifying the sequences file for the current
 folder on every message read  perhaps we look at the sequences file
 more than once per message view  

as id written the code a few months ago we were reading the sequences file 
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence  this 
happens anywhere that we look at sequences most notably in ftocshowsequences
that seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise but i wanted my abstraction to 
have a separate call for what sequences are in this folder and what 
messages are in this sequence  one option would have been to add another 
call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the checkthemodifytime 
technique would be less errorprone

i think the biggest gains would be from augmenting ftocshowsequences to allow 
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
for all messages  i described these thoughts in an email message yesterday

and again if it can wait a few weeks im willing to do it
