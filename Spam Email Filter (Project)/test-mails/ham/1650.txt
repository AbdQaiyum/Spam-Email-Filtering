im not sure if this is really a razor problemissue or a sendmail
problem heres the scenario my mail server is a mhz pc funning
freebsd  ordinarily the machine is quite idle it supports my
wifes web site with apache server running on it and a few other
services jabber etc between the various members of our family we
get a fair amount of email coming in mailing lists etc on
occasion our dslbased isp dies for a number of hours when we get a
reconnection to the internet i get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor as a result i will sometimes see
over  sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion the machine is then really slow

i noticed that my etcprocmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razorcheck there was something in the log though
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files so i have just added home etcrazor as an argument i
havent had any down time since then so i cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount this
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem the first paragraph
above but i thought i should be complete in my description

at any rate has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes  is there
perhaps a way to limit the number of sendmail processes

any ideas would be welcome

thanks
joe
