   possible
 	mmm great stuff  now to get the redhat samba packager to do the
 	same thing 

im sure that if you file a bugzilla entry with a relevant patch against
the spec file chances of getting the change done are on your side 

 	i have used there spec file and fun a few problems in it and one
 	of them was just hashing out things for other use 
 
 	now to get to grips with the kernel  still have not found and
 	easy way to rebuild the kernel without having to wait and hour for
       it to generate the headers for all arch  arrrrhhhh 

the problem is that with foo without bar is clearly not meant to
change deeply the way a package is built its use would be more like
enablingdisabling gpg ldap whateversql support in packages as its not
possible to use something like withfoobar which could be used for
a much wider scope
