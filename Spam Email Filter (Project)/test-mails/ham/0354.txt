you choose to have your email client do that  you dont have to  short
of palladium you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold including
reading messages and erasing the traces  ill buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise

an attacker might be able to verify that you have read a message eg  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy but not that you havent  
if your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail  if an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer you could run it in a spoofing vm

the only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is 
maybe  palladium
