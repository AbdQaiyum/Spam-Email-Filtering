 well i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package
 built against something that wasnt installed through rpm 

oh well  fair enough

 what id recommend in your case 

ugh way too much manual labor  

what ive done instead is to create a tiny little kernelspec that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number uname r for architecture uname p  it also claims to
provide kernelsources at the same version  that is enough to make
alsadriverspec happy and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system  i should have
thought of this approach sooner
