    accommodations to the disabled apply to internet web sites just as they do 
    to brickandmortar facilities like movie theaters and department stores 

five months ago i said within the next  months all web authoring 
tools will fully embrace css accessibility and web standards and i mean 
fully inside and out as macromedia appears to have done here with 
dreamweaver mx those tools that do not will simply fall by the wayside this 
is the new baseline seven months to go on that prediction tick tock
