james this is not an exmh problem but an interaction between sendmail
james solaris and mh

correct

james your sysadmin is wrong  it is the responsibility of the receiving mail
james server to escape lines beginning with from  if they choose to turn
james on that facility  it is not the responsibility for email clients to
james cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool and suns even more
james stupid decision to rely on contentlength instead of dealing with
james this problem  since mh is unaware of contentlength rcvstore gags
james trying to parse messages from the spool

also correct  in fairness though i cannot defend the contentlength header
as i consider it brain damage in the extreme sun inherited this from att

james get your mail administrator to add the e flag to your sendmail
james this means you will never see a line beginning with from  any such
james line will look like from 

specifically you will need to find a line in etcmailsendmailcf that
starts with mlocal such as

 grep mlocal etcmailsendmailcf
mlocal         pusrlibmaillocal flsdfmawqpsxfmnze senvfromsmtphdrfroml renvtolhdrtol
 

and make sure that e appears in the long list of flags following f
if your sysadmin uses m to generate sendmailcf and any good sysadmin
should then here is the magic line for the mc file

modifymailerflagslocal ednl

james you can learn to use procmail invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
james letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool  this avoids
james the whole issue  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time
james and everything works

also correct though procmail per se is not needed as other filters such
as slocal which is part of the nmh distribution do the trick just as well
