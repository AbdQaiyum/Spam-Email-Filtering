subject re our friends the palestinians our servants in government


john hall wrote

it wasnt gloating it was one for the horror file

and of course for the palestinians it wasnt a mistake which is a key

im not against american taxpayers remodeling a school honoring a killer

im sure the plan is that it will be renamed for the settler who kills 
the last palestinian in a few years
