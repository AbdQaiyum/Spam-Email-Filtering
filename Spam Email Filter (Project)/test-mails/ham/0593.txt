more accurately someones dream changes reality for everyone and
everyones memory adjusts to perceive the new realities as a continuum
replete with new pasts and new memories

ever have dreams that create their own history to make their irrealities
plausible and authentic feeling

ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day
im sure its some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is
still cycling thru  like a deja vu triggered by memory processes where
you dont actually remember but you feel like youre remembering

ggggggggg

isnt this the story where someones dream has the ability to change
reality  then you find the whole world is their dream
