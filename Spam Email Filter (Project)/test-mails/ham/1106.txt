  wendy ive been trying to set a button called which
  wendy automatically forwards mail using a form mycomps
  wendy without going through the editor but so far havent got
  wendy the right recipe

i have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail  the binding looks like this

set bindingskeyhddistsilently form distcompstome metadollar

the hddistsilently is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below  its getting old and 
probably should be resynced with the current code  but it 
still works on a relatively recent cvs copy of exmh

its also possible that theres an easier way but i hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked i moved 
on to other tasks

hal

proc hddistsilently  args  

    global exmh msg
    set exmhctype dist
    if string length args   
	set args mhdistsetup
    

    if msgok msgid m 
	if string compare info command args args   
	     old interface with hook procedure
	    if catch args exmhfolder m err     setup draft msg
		exmhstatus args err purple
		return
	    
	  else 
	    if catch 
		exmhstatus dist exmhfolder m
		eval mhexec dist exmhfolder m nowhatnowproc args
		mhannosetup exmhfolder m dist
	     err 
		exmhstatus dist err purple
		return
	    
	
        editdone send				 just send it
