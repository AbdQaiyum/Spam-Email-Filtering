    e  the strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high
    e that spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with
    e little effort his endurance is similarly enhanced as well

could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
humanoid cells are in fact exoskeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distancesquared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel  

this steeleffect might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
several orders of magnitude more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight like magnesiumalloy or
carbonfiber weight compared to iron spidey could even be way under
weight  only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted tensile strength
crosssectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement

    e as for the spidey senses well theyre really great but afaik
    e not really well explained in the comic series 

if the same closepacking gapfilling arachnemolecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues and thered be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorterfasterstronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system  

since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell clearly
hearing the heartbeats and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges but seem mystical to us   for peter parker
everything from air currents on his facialhairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of spideysense
dont forget that hed acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms we
know from issue  that his collisionavoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he found himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation you ok mister as if it was a hallucination

hmmm  it may even be physiopsychologically interesting to examine
if peter parkers personal quandries arose because his physiological
spidey infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not ie peter was not spiderman but
just the driver of the bus  only unlike ourselves he found his
self driving a bodyvehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive timescales
