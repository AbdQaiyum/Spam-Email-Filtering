 hmmm just as i thought  in other words it has no practical uses
 whatsoever  

tourism is the worlds largest industry using this
to preview your travels or figure out where you are
would be very valuable

online gaming continues to grow screw britannia 
reallife britain would be a fun world to wander
conquerexplore virtually in roleplaying or real
timestrategy games

and of course as james rogers points out its an
ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
overlaid data maps are great photrealistic d
maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular 

combining those last two thoughts consider the
static world map in faded colors with patches
hereandthere covered by live webcams stitched
over the static info in bright colors itd be
like the fog of war view in games like warcraft
over the real world
