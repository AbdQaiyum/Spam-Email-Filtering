   the false positive rate is   finally  i had to scrub a
   bunch of previously unnoticed spam from my inbox  both
   collections have about  messages

  tp does this mean you trained on about  of each

the total collections are  messages  i trained with 
messages 

  tp cant guess  youre in a good position to start adding more
  tp headers into the analysis though  for example an easy start
  tp would be to uncomment the headercounting lines in tokenize
  tp look for anthony  likely the most valuable thing its
  tp missing then is some special parsing and tagging of received
  tp headers

i tried the anthony stuff but it didnt make any appreciable
difference that i could see from staring at the false negative rate
the numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices

then i tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this s s  hdr word
that worked too well   the received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new

so i tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received data
and xfrom which all contained timestamps  i also skipped the xvm
headers that my mail reader added

class mytokenizertokenizer

    skip  received 
            date 
            xfrom 
            

    def tokenizeheadersself msg
        for k v in msgitems
            k  klower
            if k in selfskip or kstartswithxvm
                continue
            for w in subjectwordrefindallv
                for t in tokenizewordw
                    yield ss  k t

this did moderately better  the false negative rate is  over the
tests performed so far  this is versus  for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer

its interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators  theres not a single spamindicator in the list
most of the discriminators are header fields  one thing to note is
that the presence of mailmangenerated headers is a strong nonspam
indicator  that matches my intuition i got an awful lot of
mailmangenerated mail and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam  the other thing is that i get a lot of ham from people who use
xemacs  thats probably barry guido fred and me 

one final note  it looks like many of the false positives are from
people ive never met with questions about shakespeare  they often
start with stuff like

 dear sirmadam
 
 may i please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
 solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly i am old science student

i guess that reads a lot like spam
