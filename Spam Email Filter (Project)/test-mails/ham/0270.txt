im not familiar with dell dimension xps and to be honest not familiar
with any brandname computers most of my experience is china
motherboards but ive seen same behavior once changing the battery helps
that time it was big round battery with panasonic on it
computer starts beeping then we removed battery from mb it even booted up
well loosing time and some other things

just my  cents
