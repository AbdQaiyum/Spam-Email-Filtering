 i assume that you wont ghost or remove these and the modulesconf
 change on uninstall though  so people who are installing this rpm and
 are unfortunate enough to have a dvd drive or just an ordinary cd
 nondvd drive that doesnt support dma will be left with a system
 without a working cd drive even after removing the rpm  and without
 ever knowing what struck them  you cant remove the dma setting from
 modulesconf either unless youre sure that ogle added it there and
 nothing else needs it

ive never heard of any cdrom or dvdrom drive having problems with dma
although there probably is since red hat decided to default disabling it a
few releases back 
normally even if you try to enable dma and your device doesnt support it
it simply dont be able to make the change and thats it the problem iirc
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support dma but doesnt work as
expected when its enabled maybe chris could confirm this 

i guess ill settle for the devdvd link change as described and putting
the dma tip in the description
