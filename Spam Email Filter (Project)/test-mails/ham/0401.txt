    o from the local paper this morning  canadians eat about seven
    o times as many doughnuts per capita as americans  doh

if we had more variety of franchise food than the
wendyskfcpizzahuttacobelltimhortons monopoly they are all pepsi
under the hood arent they things might be different  when a new
yorker has biscotti we have a timbit when a parisienne has a
croissant we have a timbit  because thats all we can buy

the usa is a nation founded on creative free enterprise entrepreneurs
canada is a nation built on monopolies
