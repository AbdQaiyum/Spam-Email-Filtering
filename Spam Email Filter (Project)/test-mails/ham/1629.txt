 i too am seeing very weird things with  and awl  i  installed a
 fresh system and then ran a bunch of test spam through it all from the
 same user  all messages should have scored over   the awl kept
 adjusting them down so that after about  message i had a negative
 score  im using spamcd

thats exactly what is intended the idea is that legit senders who
habitually score just   will eventually get out of awl hell after
 messages

note that running a single spam through spamassassin a t will
eventually whitelist the spammer  but thats why the man page tells you
not to do it
