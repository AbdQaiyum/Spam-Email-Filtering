 hi
 
 ive got an normal  cdrw ide drive that id like to be able to use 
 with a dell latitude cpx laptop that ive got does anyone know any way 
  enable this for example through the use of a special cable for the
  modular bay where cdrom or floppy drive is normally

there is absolutely no way to use a conventional  drive with a
laptop directly however you can get an external firewire or usb
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that and any  drive
will work in that case
