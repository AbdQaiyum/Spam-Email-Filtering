 i dont think gpg signing my repositories will help anything as it will
 just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md signatures of
 all pgklists and srclists basically youll then just be sure that its me
 who generated the files and this will of course prevent automating the
 process of updating the apt repository when red hat updates show up

    isnt there a packagerkey thats concealed inside the rpm  things have changed a bit since i used to work withem but i thought there was some internal number that must be compared to be correct or presumably return an error
 
 in red hat linux  though the warnings about no key appear until you
 import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm for example 
 rpm import usrsharedocaptcncrpmgpgkey
 this will import my key which is used to sign all freshrpmsnet packages

    hey cool wether it protects me or not i feel better about it
 
 hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install only packages who
 verify against an imported gpg key this for me would be the optimal way to
 ensure integrity with the way things curently work

    yeah surely theres a flag for that there is for everything else aye
