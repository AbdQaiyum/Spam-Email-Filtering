 burbank says the tax would reach only a preselected group of
 consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so hes been
 pitching it as a modernday robin hood tax where the needy get a dime
 every time the affluent spend  to  on an espresso

the people who pour the espresso arent rich  an interesting issue
might be how it affects employment

still it is a  or less sales tax  that might not make that big of a
difference  

the costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous
worse than the cost of the tax itself

me i hate coffee anyway  but if they put a can tax on diet dr
pepper i might have to start buying them in oregon  yes i drink that
much diet dr pepper
