spoken in namibia
callers to the namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni which
translates roughly as lets have intercourse in the oshiwambo language
it was used in a caption concerning people in the caprivi who use rings from
the femidon  female condom  as jewellery
according to the the namibian  an activist involved in care for aidshiv
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist
he intended it to mean you will see for yourselves in the siyeyi tongue
one caller said the complainants should be considerate of other peoples
languages it is very clear that the picture was taken in the caprivi and
that the word is from siyeyi it is not oshiwambo
others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
namibian languages such as omakende an oshiwambo word for glasses which in
siyeyi means testicles
another word with a doublemeaning is tulikunde which in oshiwambo
translates as lets talk but which in sisubiya translates as lets have
intercourse
the herero word for a hat is ekoli which is an oshiwambo word for a vagina
