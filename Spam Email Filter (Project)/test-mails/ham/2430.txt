pro football players are addicted to football games as a means of 
wishfulfillment  by managing the team they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses maybe this explains the amazing success of the sims 
which on the face of it should be dull as hell while away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a dayjob and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit youd think itd be the last thing 
you want to do but its not when youre a sim you can tweak your existence a 
smidge discover what life would be like if you took path a instead of path b 
try the alternate universe on for size the idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive like the episode of 
the simpsons when mr burns runs into krusty buying krustyos at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the burnsos 

    its always a trip carr says the first time i saw myself in a video 
    game was in college at fresno state when i walked into a best buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me that kind of trips you out a little bit 
    

    for every yearold kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games theres a group of pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from madden nfl  to the 
    actionpacked halo combat evolved
