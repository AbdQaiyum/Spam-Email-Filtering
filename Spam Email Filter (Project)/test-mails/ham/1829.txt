 just curious if subject line capitalization can be used as an indicator

 either the percentage of characters that are caps

 or percentage starting with a capital letter if number of words  xx

supply a mod to tokenizerpy and ill test it eventually wink  note
that the tokenizer already preserves case in subjectline words because
experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this
specific context but experiment also showed against my
expectations that preserving case everywhere didnt make a significant
difference to either error rate  the subject line is a special case for
this
