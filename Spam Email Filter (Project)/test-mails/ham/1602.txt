 probably better than the spam phrases approach would be the database
 approach as currently used for whiteblack listing
 any way to tie that to an xml retrieval from a list of central repositories
 does mysql do replication a properly done xml would let us eyeball the list
 as well as use it to keep the database up to date
 another idea could we synthesize an rbl so that
 httpwwwspammercomspamwebbug becomes spamwebbugxwwwspammercom
 for a reverse lookup it is going to get tricky how to specify a randomized
 intermediate directory

a good plan needs an implementation though

hmm seems down to me  basically its a plan to store hash sums of
urlsphone numbers found in spam in a dnsbl for apps like spamassassin to
look up  a little like spamcops spamvertized url list
