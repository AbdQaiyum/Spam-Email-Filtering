  using trancode rpm i cant get transcode command line args to
  workalthough its been a while since i used it  maybe i forgot how

this was a dumb mistake on my part i didnt have libdvdcssdevel the
transcode command line args work fine now but not so for dvdrip
thanks for help
alvie
 
 im encoding a dvd to divx right now on my home computer and it works
 fine my current red hat  build of transcode has avifile support
 disabled that may be your problem its because gcc  isnt currently
 able to recompile avifile
