hi
this is my first problem with one of the freshrpms rpms 
i just upgrade mplayer and now i get

 mplayer 
mplayer error while loading shared libraries libdvdnavso cannot open shared object file no such file or directory

i guess matthias has forgotten libdvdnav dependency

 
they told me i needed win or better
so i chose linux
