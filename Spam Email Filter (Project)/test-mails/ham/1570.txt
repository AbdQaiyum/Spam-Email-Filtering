 its probably that razor needs to be razorregisterd for each user
 try creating a worldwritable home dir for razor and dcc et al to store
 their files in that way spamd will share the razor server info etc
 between all users

uh no you dont want to make it worldwritable  worldreadable

 then use spamd h pathtoworldwriteabledir 

just remember that the razor and whatever dcc uses needs to be
worldreadable as well  the solution is then to make a worldwritable
log file for at least razor  i like symlinking devnull myself

 imo this is more efficient than using spamd h which will use each
 users own home dir for this data but its a matter of opinion 

efficient  probably depends on the user base but it also takes
the control away from the user which may or may not be a good thing
depending again on the user base
