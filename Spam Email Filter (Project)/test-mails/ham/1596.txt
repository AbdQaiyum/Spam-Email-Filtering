no i was just a little confused because im running procmail on a gateway
and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead
server  so there isnt any delivery to the local system

the only email it gets is inbound at the moment and were looking to get rid
of complication and go back to two boxes  i did a test which looked like
you guys are right about procmail but testing is very limited due to the
config i currently have  its just confusing when set up as a gateway

 is there is way to separate inbound and outbound email so that i only
check
 for spam on inbound mail and ignore the outbound
 
 im using sendmail and running procmail on the gateway to call
spamassassin
 i know it more of a sendmail question but my google searches have only
 turned up people trying to log all inbound and outbound email
 
using procmail spamassassin doesnt get called for outgoing email
messages sent to other machines 
procmaillocal delivery agent  inbound traffic to local machine
