hi all

ive decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers as usual the result is
that ive spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs but hey some of you will benefit from
that right 

ive got the whole thing working on a valhalla system but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on enigma limbonull and
maybe others who knows 

here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out 
 recompile the alsadriver source rpm for your running kernel
  you can install the binary package if youre using the i 
 install this alsadriver package
 install the alsalibs package
 install the alsautils package

now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your
etcmodulesconf file to replace the default oss driver loading 
httpwwwalsaprojectorgalsadoc
very complete and very good documentation
hopefully youll see that your card is supported 

reboot or remove by hand your current sound modules youll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource by hand and
insert the new ones if all is well youve got alsa working dmesg to
check is a good idea you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
eg aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default

with aplay you can already test files to see if you hear anything you
can also install the xmms plugin seems to make my xmms segfault on exit
hmmm but maybe its another plugin to listen to your good ol mp
files thats it

it really isnt complicated and has never been from what i see the only
thing i disliked was to have to install from source but as i cant
imagine myself doing that  ive repackaged everything cleanly even the
dev entries are included in the rpm package and not created by an ugly
post script i insist and seamlessly integrate into the etcmakedevd
structure there are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided alsa spec files for example ive split alsalibs
development files into an alsalibdevel package and included static
libraries there are others of course oh yes the kernel version against
which the alsadriver package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release so does the architecture

im open to any comments or suggestions about these packages
