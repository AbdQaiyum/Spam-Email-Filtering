 my tests train on about  msgs and a binary pickle of the database is
 approaching  million bytes

that shrinks to under  million bytes though if i delete all the wordinfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to unknownspamprob  such records
arent needed when scoring an unknown word gets a madeup probability of
unknownspamprob  such records are only needed for training ive noted
before that a scoringonly database can be leaner

in part the bloat is due to character graming part due to that the
database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk and part
due to plain evil gremlins
