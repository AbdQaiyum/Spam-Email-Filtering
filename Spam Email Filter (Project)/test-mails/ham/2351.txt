so dya remember that whole css debate that flared up about six months ago 
actually it flares up continuously in various circles in fact i think its 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles these things are 
inexorably cyclical cssvstables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world 
but i digress 

if you were around back then you will no doubt recall that i was in the 
procss camp 

so anyway dya remember that argument that went something like you 
should design with web standards and css because it will futureproof your site 
for the pieinthesky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices well its crap 

there are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and css 
automatically printfriendly pages dynamic style switchers reduced 
bandwidth and aiding and abetting accessibility a topic which i claim 
to know a lot about among others but because itll futureproof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices is not one of them 
the theory is solid but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices now that we have them how it was all supposed to work in practice 
oops
