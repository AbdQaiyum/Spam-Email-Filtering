    you can learn to use procmail
 
 can this be done via forward
 
 make your forward contain only the following line
 usrbinprocmail
  incl the quotes your procmail binary may be in another path
 
check the procmail documentation  they actually recommend

ifs ppathtoprocmailtest f pexec p fexit 
uniquestring

i dont know what this does but it is explained in the doc
