thanks for this information  i gave alsa a try couldnt figure out how
to enable digital out although im sure if i put enough time into it
could have gotten it working  also when playing mps in analog mode
every time i switched between mps there was a bit of static  noticed a
new distribution geared towards audio applications agnula
httpwwwagnulaorg uses alsa as well  seems though the latest
open source emuk drivers sblive  work fair enough  anyone else
experience these problems with alsa  are there alot of people on this
list using alsa

regards

 ok i do this every time i update a kernel
 
 the st time i added alsa i tried a nonroot rpom build but the dev things were not
 made other than that i bet you could do nonroot the following can be scripted
 easily
 
  get a alsadrivers b alaslib and c alsautils tarballs if upgrading the
 kernel then you probably have them from your last install
  unpack them somewhere
  for each of them go to the top directory of the unpacked tarball and do
 configure then look in im going by memory topdirutils you should see a spec
 file there do this for the  tarballs and you get  spec files
 
  put the source tarballs in sources and the spec files in specs go in order from
 a b then c doing
  rpmbuild ba specsalsaxspec rpm uvh rpmsialsaxrpm
 
  do that in order for the  spec files and you have just installed the alsa
 drivers on your system the st time you do this you need to put the correct stuff
 in your modulesconf file may take some research then you get the alsa driver and
 oss compat capabilities or you can choose not to use the oos compat stuff
 
 script making the spec then building and upgrading as above and you have
 nosweat alsa
 
 note the null rpmbuild did take some tweaking it does a check for files in the
 buildroot that you dont specify in your files section in this case there is an
 extra file going by memory includesysasoundh add a line at the end on the
 install section of the spec file to delete that file and you are good to go

  probably when red hat linux gets a  kernel  until then a few places
  provide good quality alsa packages but indeed you still have to patch and
  recompile your kernel
 
 not so  alsa is buildable independently of the kernel
 
  maybe some day ill try alsa never done it yet and that day you can
  expect all needed packages to appear on freshrpmsnet 
 
 id be interested in working with you on that if you want those
 packages
