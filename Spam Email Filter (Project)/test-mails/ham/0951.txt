 contentmanagement vendor documentum said late thursday it plans to
acquire
 privately held eroom technologies in a deal worth about  million

 documentum will issue approximately  million shares of its common stock
 and pay about  million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
 eroom

 documentum makes a platform for enterprisewide content management eroom
 makes tools for enterprise collaboration its customers include airbus
 bausch  lomb ford motor co and sony

 documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new collaboration
 edition of its contentmanagement suite eroom was already integrating its
 tools to the documentum platform making an acquisition an easy target
 according to documentum president and ceo dave dewalt

 with the upcoming joint product customers will be able to collaborate in
 realtime via virtual workspaces sharing schedules resources and even
 jointly creating content

 content creation and management has always been a collaborative task but
 workflow has usually been delivered via a web browser interface or even
 simple email  and rarely in realtime

 for now documentum will sell the eroom platform and its own
 contentmanagement system through combined sales channels further
 integration is planned down the line the companies said
