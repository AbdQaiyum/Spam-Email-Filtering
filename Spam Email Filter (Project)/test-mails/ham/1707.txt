im still seeing razor reporting bomb out with a small variety of messages
would reinitializing something here help or does razor do that as needed
anyway and this just reflects trouble at the servers

also since these are reports im making from within mutt its annoying
that the error messages garble the x window a bit if theres nothing
constructive to do about razor failing can i at least turn off the failure
messages one way or the other id rather not see them
