i think one step towards deployment is creating a reusable tokenizer
for mail messages  the current codebase doesnt expose an easytouse
or easytocustomize tokenizer

the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasnt
designed for reuse  id like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one

id like to see the tokenize by customizable too  tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data because there were particular biases
in the test data  if other people have test data without those
biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others
