 well my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
 a spam hits     any higher does us no good as it means an fp is
 a lot harder to recover from using compensation rules

agreed

but i have always thought that the value  was not the best value  it
should have been   i understand that initially only spammy scores
were included  but i believe the algorithm should be purely
symmetrical and nonspammy negative values should also have been
balancing out the spammy positive values like they do in sa today
then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
would be nonspam  and i guess exactly zero is grey  todays
choice of  just adds an offset  which i think cause people to assume
things work differently than they do
