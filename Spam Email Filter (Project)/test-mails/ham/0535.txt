  it also depends on what the fad is or what is in style  
 
 dnas idea of fads is on the  kiloyear scale unfortunately as long as
 current fads dont involve invivo rewrite of the genome homeoboxes
 including now theres a problem for you homeoboxing the adult theyre
 not all that smart an idear

i forgot what we were taking about  

  
  actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have
  resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page and musical
  instrumnet and canvas  whats the problem if we dash a little mrs
 
 art is sure nice however if art is our first priority were kinda
 fuxred if weve set our sight on a sustainable culture

nah didnt say arts our priority  said our ideas about relationships 
and love are  

  and let me tell you this just because a child happens to be
  singleparented what a word does not mean that child is
  dysfunctional or lives in a dysfunctional home  the govtmediachurch
 
 our firmware is not built to be singleparented you can counteract that
 somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends but not too
 many do that

i see it a lot in the south also family

 
  has tried to make it look like there is a disintegration when in
  fact there is a coming together of other family members and friends
  to raise children  its not decaying  its changing  nothing wrong
  with change
 
 i dont know what exactly is wrong but something is definitely wrong  
 this is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is
 right and what is wrong

one thing thats wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters  too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important  i 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things  i threw the tv out when xi was   shes got her 
own place now and still doesnt have one  yay  another thing thats 
wrong is what goes on in public schools  some allow a bit of 
individuality but only for a class or a short period of time depending 
on the teachers most of the time  i dunno how many times ive seen xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school  she made it to college though whew  its a 
big problem to tackle and i dont know the answer  i like the idea of 
the voucher system because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught

 
      at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
   counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia were doing
   something wrong
   
   maybe we should really go dirty tleilaxu all the way
   
  
  maybe yall should buy mw some more bandwidth
