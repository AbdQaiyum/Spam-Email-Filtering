bm does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept
bm been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i dont yet know
bm i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
bm this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server
bm systems it would allow for the hardwareseparation of volatile and
bm nonvolatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly
bm ghosting operations only it would be more efficient and involve less or
bm no downtime

bm thanks for any opinions
