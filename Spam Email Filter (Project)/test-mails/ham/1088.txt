i am a tvtwm user when i snarf text into my mouse cut buffer and then
attempt to inject it into the exmh input windows for comprepl the point
is often an apparently random place in the text pane not where i think i
have current flashing cursor 

i usually wipe out any of tosubjectrandom body with the text its
often not even beginning of line denoted ie its an unexplicable number
of char spaces in to the text where it inserts 

what am i doing wrong in either x wm shell exmh which is causing this

cheers
