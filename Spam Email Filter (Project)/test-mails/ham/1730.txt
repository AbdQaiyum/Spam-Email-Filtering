 ah in that case you can use something considerably less powerful than
 vmware all you need is a machine configured to boot from cdrom and use
 a ram disk for scratch space numerous linux distros are available that
 let you boot a stateless but functional system from cdrom
 
 but ram is expensive and the directory structures of many systems eg
 windows are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
 combination of bootable cds and ram drives practical even if you are
 fortunate enough to be using linux or another fhscompliant nix you
 still cant fit a lot on a cd its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
 static multimedia content on the web server this particular problem can be
 alleviated somewhat by using dvds but this is a temporary solution at best
 which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
 drives become cheaper

so just writeprotect the hard disk for partitions that are static
i seem to recall an article on this early s byte magazine perhaps
for bbs systems or for testing unknown perhaps trojan horse software
