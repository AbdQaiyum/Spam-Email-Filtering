    damn this thing is slick  someone seems to have done a very complete qa test on it yesterday i installed it for the first time on an old celeron box  sure parts of it were slow but compared to my more modern machine everything is  it was good a beautiful interface that legions of sheep can look at and say cool i can understand this and leave their shackles behind  

    i was struck by the massive amount of applications both kde and gnome intuitively seperated not by the gnomekde names but by their meanings instead  its obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more international the web browser graphic for example has a world icon with a mouse wrapped around it officeapps have familiar pens paper andor calculators involved

    this is a linux that i can plop down in front of almost anyone and they can figure it out

    at some point id miss the character of kdegnome and ill probably hotrod the graphics setup with my own themes etc  but for the wide release this ones it  if you get a chance try this i think youll be surprisingly pleased
