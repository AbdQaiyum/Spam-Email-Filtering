 ive had this binding in my exmhexmhbindings for years
 
 set bindingskeyflistfindunseen   incpresortfinish keyf
 
 after updating to the current code in cvs i get bad key f when 
 i hit the f key  i can open the bindings commands window 
 and define the binding  it then works until i restart exmh
 
 i suspect a parsing problemchange  ill try to look into this 
 tomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be

flistfindunseen has changed to flistfindseqs  it takes the same arguments 
but i changed the name because it looks for all the sequences not just the 
unseen sequence
