lately ive got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower i 
just decided to check that vs reality and yes speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of  and now

i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder  
msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably

release  msec
latest cvs  msec

frankly i think this is getting close to nonacceptable since the 
user settings hasnt changed

anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared
