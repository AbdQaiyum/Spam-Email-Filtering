dvd capture is an applescript for os x that captures screengrabs from dvds os 
x normally disables screencapture while the dvd player is running even if it 
isnt visible i have some home movies on dvd that id love to get stills 
from but i cant  the dvd licensing board has forced apple to break my 
hardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful 
to make sure that i never ever grab a frame out of police academy n   
nice to see that independent software authors are willing to unbreak my gear 
for me link discuss thanks patrick
