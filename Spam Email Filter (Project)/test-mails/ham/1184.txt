 how do i tell apt hold all kernel packages can i use syntax like 
 kernel  
 
 and i dont quite understand what the part kernel means

you could read about regular expressions
kernel matches kernel and nothimg more
kerne kernelsmp and kernelenterprise are the kernel packages you
might be running in a rh system packages like kernelheaders
kernelboot and kerneldoc arent matched if it just said kernel it
would match all those packages
