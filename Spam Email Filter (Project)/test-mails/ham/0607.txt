    g you meant surprisingly perceptive didnt you  

of course dear  especially without zazen training  veritably
operational thetanlike

    g recent exceptionally vivid and strange dreams lead me to
    g believe im sparking synapses that have lain dormant lo these
    g many years  lots of problem solving going on up there at
    g night

its a myth that we dont use parts of our brain  we use it all
always  its just that our culturallyinduced focalpoint causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste  of it  lucid is
a measure of notchfilter bandwidth all stations are broadcasting
but we only choose easy rock 

for example dont look now but your shoes are full of feet

the sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a turning on
of circuits it is a tuning in  the next step of course is to
drop out 

to paraphrase an old saw life is wasted on the living
