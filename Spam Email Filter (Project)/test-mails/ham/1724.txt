 simple approxmation to this make usr a separate partion and mount it

 readonly

     the good news attackers that want to trojan your software have to
      reboot at least
     the bad news administrators that want to update your software
      have to reboot at least

no reboot is required you just need to remount it

	 mount o remountrw usr

this requires root access but presumably usr is safe from nonroot
users anyway

only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities lidsetc on linux for example or to
remove capsysadmin with lcap which would definately require a reboot
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot  pun intended  my
apologies
