   ive never heard of any cdrom or dvdrom drive having problems with
   dma although there probably is since red hat decided to default
   disabling it a few releases back 
  
  when i worked as a pc repair tech for a computer store chain i did
  run across quite a few dvd drives that would lock up if dma was
  enabled  its more of a chipsetdrive problem than a drive by itself
 
 and my ibm intellistation would lock up instantly  now this is actually 
 quite funny  if dma was enabled for the cdrom and you tried to access 
 a cd with joliet extensions otherwise it worked just fine with dma 
 enabled 

odd did i certify that one whats the digit ibm model number and
which version of red hat were you running
