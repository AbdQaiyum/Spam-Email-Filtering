 unfortunately when i run that it complains about the h parameter

 but i can run it on the command line as spamd d c a h just fine

 anyone else run into this problem

you look to have  versions of spamd installed  the one running from
the rc script is pre there is a h now and f has been removed
but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a x version

i would find that old version of sa and blow it away
