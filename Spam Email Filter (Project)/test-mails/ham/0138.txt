  the only way you can resolve this to my knowledge is to download the
 original libvorbis rpm and the new one remove the old one then do
 
  rpm uvh libvorbis
 
  rpm then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time
 and does so why you cant do this after you have one library already
 installed is beyond me

does using the oldpackage flag help your pain or is your pain caused 
by obsoletes flags
