after my latest cvs up timtest fails with

    traceback most recent call last
      file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in 
        drivensets
      file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in drive
        d  driver
      file homeskipsrcspambayestimtestpy line  in init
        selfglobalhamhist  histoptionsnbuckets
    attributeerror optionsclass object has no attribute nbuckets

im running it as

    timtest n  datatimtestout

from my mail directory not from my srcspambayes directory  if i
create a symlink to srcspambayesbayesini it works once again but
shouldnt there be an nbuckets attribute with a default value already

skip
