i feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of netscape vs 
mozilla i told netscape management that if the netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that cnet would write an article on it they didnt believe me 
or didnt care sure enough the article appeared right on time

i blogged about two main annoyances when installing netscape  the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars i warned netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem they didnt listen take a look at the cnet review highlight that 
describes the bad part of netscape 

displays aol ads everywhere doesnt let you turn off popup windows like 
mozilla does devours mb of disk space

plenty of other engineers at netscape as well as managers complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems we 
lost every battle the simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
netscape browser are incompetent they dont understand how to make a good 
browser or they dont care their engineers tell them what theyre doing 
wrong and they dont listen 

maybe youll listen to the public how about eweeks article netscape  
shrivels under mozillas shadow are you paying attention now you ignorant 
stupid incompetent buffoons

i told you so never felt so good

maybe they will sit up and take notice now if they do well its about 
fucking time and people wonder why i quit working for aol
