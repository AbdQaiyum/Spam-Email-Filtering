 heh ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not 
 parroting the party line

 it was even less so thirty years ago my story remains the same take 
 it or leave it ive said the same words to white supremacists as to 
 suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to french irish etc etc

 i dont have to agree with anything you say i am obligated to 
 defend to the death your right to say it i dont give a rats ass 
 where you say it even in france i dont care where the political 
 pendulum has swung currently

protestors he said something like they couldnt do that in iraq 
meanwhile from what i could tell the protestors were being arrested
