hello

has anyone made a working source rpm for dvdrip for red hat 
matthias has a spec file on the site for  and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvdrip website including one i patched
a while ago but it appears that the makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the perl libraries into the systems and also at the
moment dvdrip needs to be called with perliostdio as it seems to not
work with perlio on rhs perl

not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is  anyone working on
this

thanks
