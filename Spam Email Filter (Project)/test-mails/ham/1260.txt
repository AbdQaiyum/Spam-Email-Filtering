     dag doesnt have the authorization to communicate with the
     dag laptop beeing another user
   
   i dont know anything about the kde sound server but id guess 
   your problem is the environment in which procmail runs  you 
   dont say what procmail is running from  in my case for 
   example procmail is run from fetchmail which is run by a cron 
   job
  
  sorry about that
  procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
  i get
  but anyway i found an error message in procmaillog which solved
  the problem
  the following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now
  
  displaylaptop artsplay soundfile
 
 btw if you use exmhwrapper found in the misc directory you can generalize 
 this to
 
 displaycat homeexmhdisplay artsplay soundfile

yes but that probably means that you have to have exmh
running on the laptop to get the notification
with exmh getting upset by two instances running at the
same time this creates the problem that i cannot  run to the
closest compter to check out the new mail

but thanks for the hint i might use that for some other
hack
