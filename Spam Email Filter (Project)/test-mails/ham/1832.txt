 woops  i didnt have the summary files so i regenerated them using a
 slightly different set of data  here are the results of enabling the
 received header processing

     false positive percentages
             won    
             won    
             tied
             tied
             won    
             won    

     won    times
     tied   times
     lost   times

     total unique fp went from  to  won    

     false negative percentages
             won    
             tied
             won    
             won    
             won    
             tied

     won    times
     tied   times
     lost   times

     total unique fn went from  to  won    

 my test set is different than tims in that all the email was received
 by the same account  also my set contains email sent to me not to
 mailing lists i use a different addresses for mailing lists

enabling the received headers works even better for me wink heres the
fn section from a quick run on element subsets

        won    
        tied
        won   
        won    
        won    
        won   
        won   
        won    
        won    
        won    
        won    
        won    
        tied
        won    
        won   
        won    
        won   
        won   
        lost  was 
        won   

won   times
tied   times
lost   times

total unique fn went from  to  won    

a huge improvement but for wrong reasons  except not entirely  the most
powerful discriminator in the whole database on one training set became

        receivedunknown  

thats got nothing to do with bruceg right

        receivedbfsmediacom

was also a strong spam indicator across all training sets  im jealous

 if people cook up more ideas i will be happy to test them

neil are using your own tokenizer now or the tokenizertokenizertokenize
generator  whichever someone whos not afraid of their headers should try
adding mboxtestmytokenizertokenizeheaders into the mix once in lieu of
tokenizertokenizertokenizeheaders and again in addition to it  jeremy
reported on just the former
