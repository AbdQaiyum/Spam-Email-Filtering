i know that i did this during the week that all the catalogues were
hokey but after that i changed it back to discovery  so i can see why
people are using honor

folks 

some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue
server there are three catalogue only servers running now and honor is
acting as a nomination only server tonight we will be completely
turning off catalogue support on honor so if you are specifying honor
with the rs option please take it out and let the agents discover a
closeby catalogue server

cheers
