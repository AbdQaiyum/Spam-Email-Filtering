 any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for
 inclusion w the spambayes project

i gave it all the thought it deserved wink  it would be wonderful to get
several people cranking on the same test data and im all in favor of that
otoh my data subtree currently has more than  files slobbering over
 million bytes  even if i had a place to put that much stuff im not
sure my isp would let me email it in one msg wink

apart from that there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that
this isnt the data i hoped i was using  i hoped i was using a snapshot
of only recent msgs to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 
but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium  greg ward is
currently capturing a stream coming into pythonorg and i hope we can get a
more modern and cleaner test set out of that  but if that stream contains
any private email it may not be ethically possible to make that available
can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample apart from a
public mailing list  everyones eager to share their spam but spam is so
much alike in so many ways thats the easy half of the data collection
problem
