 how easy would it be to code a menu item that marks as read all messages 
 before the current message  i often have problems reading heavytraffic 
 mailing lists in exmh because i want to read only a subset of a lists 
 messages but i lose track of where i was in the particular folder  
 
 this could also be coded more generally in the new sequences code as a way to 
 remove all messages before current from a particular sequence

easy

first youll have to excuse me as im still using   so this
may not play well with recent changes  i did look at  too
and i just did this off the top of my head i wanted to see if it
 still worked so this is somewhat untested

adding a menu entry is trivial add this to your exmhexmhdefaults

fopsmoremuentrylist	ketchup
fopsmoremlketchup		catchup all b cur
fopsmoremcketchup	 	mymarkcurseen

then you just need to provide the source for mymarkcurseen and 
arrange for exmh to include it put it in your tkexmh directory
in your usertcl or in pickpatch if you enable the source hook
under prefshacking support

its going to look something like this

proc mymarkcurseen  
    global exmh pick msg
    exmhstatus clearing unseen up to cur red
    mhsetcur exmhfolder msgid
    set pickids get message ids for pick cur
    busy pickmarkseen
    exmhstatus ok blue


thats based upon the guts of pickmarkseen

you need to fill in the code for the get section i ran out of
time

john

 it just works tm
