so like many young children my daughter tatum age  months really
likes music she also likes to have control over her environment and this
means she wants to be the one putting cds into the cd player and getting
the music playing

by watching tatum ive discovered that you can learn a lot about ui design
from watching montholds use technology there is definitely a market
niche for a toddlerfriendly cdmp player

the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button but
doesnt provide instantaneous feedback that the button was pushed instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts  seconds this is a ui
disaster since tatum doesnt get feedback right away she presses the
button again thereby pausing the cd before it even plays shell only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times this happens a
surprising amount of the time since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesnt play

for toddlers pressing play must cause the music to start immediately
within half a second for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times as well pressing the button multiple times shouldnt
change the semantics like an elevator button no matter how many times you
press the elevator still comes to that floor the play button needs to be
the same

the backhinged door mechanism feeding the cd into the player is also a ui
disaster for tatum since the door hinges on the back tatum has to angle
cds to put them in and take them out putting cds in isnt much of a
problem but taking them out is since tatum grabs cds by the back edge
that edge comes out first hitting the lid tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the cd out a process thats hard on the cd and the player but
which hasnt yet resulted in the cd player being broken surprisingly it
hasnt been a problem getting the cd hole onto the spindle  tatum seems to
understand this concept and the cd load area geometry naturally guides the
cd

tatums cd player also plays tapes and has fm radio for a toddler this is
a mistake tatum doesnt understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode she understands putting a cd in and pressing
the play button she sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song
but uses them erratically as well the radio feature has both fm mono and
fm stero a distinction totally lost on tatum tatum only understands the
binary distinction of musicno music

what would the ideal toddler cd player be like it would immediately start
playing a cd after it was loaded as soon as the cd load door was closed it
would give some audible feedback it would have a single large play button
the other typical cd controls would be larger than normal but at least half
the size of the play button and located far away from the play button so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play
the play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player and different from the color of the other cd control keys the
device would only play cds no other functions the cd load area would flip
open at least  degrees it should be small approachable for a toddler it
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 
without affecting the player
