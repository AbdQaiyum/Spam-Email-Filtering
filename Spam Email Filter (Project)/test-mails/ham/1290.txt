  where you can see 
  available rpmbuild rebuild options 
  with  alsa
  without  aalib lirc libdv arts
 
 does this mean when rebuilding the package ill
 simply
 type 
  rpmbuild rebuild packagesrcrpm with alsa 

yes it does and if youre missing the dependencies needed for the selected
options youll even be informed for alsa youll need alsalibdevel for
example

  id like to aks this on the rpmzzzlist  would a new
  dependency of k the
  alsalib package for many packages mplayer ogle
  xine be a problem for
  the freshrpmsnet packages users as i really feel
  like blending alsa in
  now especially since ive just spent some time
  recompiling alsakernel
  package for all the psyche kernels
  
 
 ill have no problem at all with this and you get my
 vote on this one 
 
 one problem with alsakernel that ive experienced
 everytime rh issues a new kernel update i have to
 rebuild my alsakernel to match the new kernel

yup unfortunately the alsakernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel
and theres no way of avoiding it
