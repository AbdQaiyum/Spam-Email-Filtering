 bug report  

hi

first of all sorry for not replying to your private email from last week
but i really dont have a slight idea of what could be causing this
 is this with different dvds or a single one
 is this using oss or alsa have you tried both
 is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones

i remember a user having trouble with a particular dvd ever since upgrading
libdvdcss to a recent version but havent heard the end of the story
