  i think we should even add new gad rules to x andor remove old
  ones and tag a new  only if we have a bunch of features worth a
  dangerous big update id say yes you should expect  and also
   but update to  now

 i would think adding new rules to or removing broken rules from x
 would require some discussion first  but new gad scores are definitely
 worth putting in as the ones there are too wild

i think my mail wasnt very clear  my point was that we should continue 
releasing new rules and removing broken ones all based on discussions on 
this list of course in the  branch instead of creating a new  branch 
everytime we have a bunch of new rules

a new branch should be openend only if big new features are introduced 
eg bayes or the interface has changed spamlevelcharx as the rules 
are under fluent development the user has to update quite regularly but 
currently he couldnt be shure if the new release will break anything in 
his setup like f going away so if we say the branches are stable to 
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
when you update to a new minor version number users and sysadmins could 
be less reluctant to update

all just imho o
