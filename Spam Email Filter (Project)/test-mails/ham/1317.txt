   well i dont really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package
   built against something that wasnt installed through rpm 
 
  following that reasoning ive been installing all my custombuilt
  kernels through rpm recently i find it annoying though that
  alsakernel and similar packages will only build for the currently
  running kernel
 
  so ive attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
  targetkernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you
  still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed but at
  least it doesnt have to be currently running its kinda hackish so
  if someone has a better way to do this let me know
 
 that idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more what
 you sent doesnt support packages named kernelsmp id also prefer a
 cleaner way than the env variable and preferrably not editing the spec
 probably define target xxxx with smp sound good enough
 the buildrequires on kernelsource will also need to be removed because
 it wont necessarily need to be true and that does bug me a bit 

	me and my kernel rpm builds  this all works along the same idea i have 
been aiming for but the freaking redhat kernel srpms still have been stump 


	if we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel  but then the size of these rpms 
are huge at least for us n world courties   

	i will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working 
idea 

thanks guys
