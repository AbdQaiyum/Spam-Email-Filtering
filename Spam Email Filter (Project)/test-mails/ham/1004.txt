  i just ran across a false positive that scored   the message was
  a solicited ad from applecom on educator deals  i can send a copy
  if anyone wants it

yes please do send it on and ill add it to the nonspam corpus

to any particular address  i checked the lists page but didnt see 
an address to see a fp to

to date the scores evolved by spamassassin are very biased towards
nonhtml nonnewsletterish mail  this release should be different as
ive been spending the last month signing up a nonspamtrap to every
legit newsletter i can find 

thats understandable  html mail is the worst thing since female 
shoe sales at the mall   signup for the cruisercustomizingcom 
newsletter  great place to find and review motorcycle parts 

this should mean that tests which match commonenough newsletter practices
will no longer get such high scores once we rerun the ga

sound pretty slick  if i come across any more legit newsletters 
ill send them your way

thanks for the info
  justin
