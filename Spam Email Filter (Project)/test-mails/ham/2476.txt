feorag writes from scotland you probably havent heard of john otway but he 
has a small and devoted following here he did a limited issue cd and asked his 
fans to vote on which track theyd like to see as a single the one they 
picked just entered the uk charts at number  bet thatll piss off the major 
record labels especially as the marketing budget was probably about zero i 
might just watch top of the pops this week link discuss thanks
