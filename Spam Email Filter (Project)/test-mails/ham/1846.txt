followups to spambayespythonorg please unless youre specifically
 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for pythonorg

ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etceximeximconf and
etceximlocalscanpy on mailpythonorg i am fairly confident that
i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moments notice  for the
record heres how it all works

   eximconf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    etceximharvest does not exist  that is any junk mail
    condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists
    is handled entirely in eximconf the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to localscanpy  this covers such diverse cases as
    message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command
    no messageid header and bit chars in subject both rejected
    after the message headersbody are read

    the main things i have changed in the absence of etceximharvest
    are
       dont check for bit chars in from header  the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin
       do header sender verification ie ensure that theres a
        verifiable email address in at least one of from replyto
        and sender as late as possible because it requires dns
        lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns
        lookups timeout

   if etceximharvest exists then the behaviour of all of those
    acls in eximconf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages they add an xreject header to the message  this
    header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the
    smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message

    thus those messages will now be seen by localscanpy which now
    looks for the xreject header  if found it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the
    smtp error message also given in xreject  currently xreject is
    retained in saved messages

    if a message was not tagged with xreject then localscanpy
    runs the usual virus and spam checks  namely my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows
    executables and a run through spamassassin  the logic is
    basically this
      if virus
          folder  virus
      else
          run through spamassassin
          if score  
              folder  rejectedspam
          elif score  
              folder  caughtspam

    finally localscanpy writes the message to the designated folder
    by far the biggest folder will be accepted  the server handles
     incoming messages per day of which maybe  are junk
    mail  oops just realized i havent written the code that actually
    saves the message  dohh  also havent written anything to
    discriminate personal email which i must do  sigh

   finally the big catch waiting until after youve read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic
    because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers
    dont consider a xx after data as a permanent error but keep
    retrying  dohh  this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time  but in harvest mode
    everything with the exception of people probing for open relays
    will be rejected at data time  so i have cooked up something called
    the asbl or automated sender blacklist  this is just a berkeley db
    file that maps senderip senderaddress to an expiry time  when
    localscan rejects a message from senderip senderaddress 
    for whatever reason including finding an xreject header added by
    an acl in eximconf  it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry
    time  hours in the future  meanwhile theres an acl in eximconf
    that checks for records in the asbl if theres a record for the
    current senderip senderaddress that hasnt expired yet we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body

    the downside of this from the pointofview of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming pythonorg one smtp
    connection per address we will most likely only get one copy  this
    is a win if youre just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth but im not sure if its helpful for training spam
    detectors  tim

happy harvesting
