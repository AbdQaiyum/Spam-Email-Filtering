   and yes i accept patchescommentssuggestions about all those spec
   files
 
 sure thing 

cool 

 ive added to the spec some flags to remove oss and isapnp support at
 build time if one wishes to so iss possible to do a
 
 	rpmbuild recompile rpm without oss without isapnp

ok ill add this

 also having the kernel compiled by me i have no kernelsource package
 installed  ive added a flag kernsrc that also can be used
 without to remove the dependency for kernelsource at build time  it
 would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
 libmodulesuname rbuildincludelinuxh though however im
 a beginner in rpm building  is it possible to buildrequire for a file
 not provided by a package at all  ive googled a bit and found no way
 to do that

requiring a file that isnt part of an rpm is not possible no except
maybe by stopping the build process if it isnt found but thats errr
ugly
and i really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources the
easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too

 i was also considering adding some sort of flag for the withcards
 option in alsas configure but dont know how to do that  only found
 out about without from your first alsadriverspec and existing rpm
 docs dont help much

this would be a tricky one since to use the with name feature of
rpmbuild i think youd need to add individual handling of each and every
card 

 oh and one more thing   at first ive installed the first version of
 alsadriver for  although i dont have that kernel to supply
 the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpms and compiled the modules
 from source  it created the dev files and all

thats what the alsadriver is there for create all the base files
excluding the kernel drivers what i would suggest for dependency reasons
it to install an alsakernel for the original kernel youve kept it
right  and install alsa modules from source for custom kernels built
from source

 then wanted to make my own rpm for  so now im trying to rpmbuild
 the alsakernel package  removed all alsa rpms and tried my spec
 
 rpmbuild ba alsadriverspecmine without oss without isapnp
 without kernsrc
 
 but i get this
 
 long successful compile snipped
 rpm build errors
       file listed twice devadsp
       file listed twice devamidi
       installed but unpackaged files found
      etcmakedevdmacros
      etcrcdinitdalsasound
 
 
 oh and i think ive forgot to mention im running betanull 

indeed  the rpm  snapshot in null has a few new features among which
having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not
listed in the files section i should remove them manually as part of the
build process or maybe the new exclude pathtofile in the files
section would do but i dont know how older versions of rpm would handle
it on my null build system ive simply set the variable 
unpackagedfilesterminatebuild
