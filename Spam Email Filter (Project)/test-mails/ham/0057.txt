no  you get unfiltered access with a real but dynamic ip address

  difficulties with voip or connecting to clients connected to a nated

you will probably suffer from the high latency of dls lines  typically
youre talking about ms rtt to the local bas which is pretty high
if your voip application can handle this then youre ok

whats the deal with all this latency its not like that in other places 
where ive used dsl i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that however my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian and i dont understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a  foot 
long piece of copper perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
timespace continuum can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less
