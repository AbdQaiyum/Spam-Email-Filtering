 in my experience there are spam messages that sneak past spam assassin
 that razor will pick up those are the ones that im calling marginal
 basically im hoping that the collective of razor users make a better
 judge of spam than any single program like sa can and therefore i can
 benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering ive
 seen examples of this already where sa doesnt score the spam high enough
 to bounce it but razor does

i think perhaps you missed the fact that sa scores are adjustable  if
you want sa to tag all messages listed in razor then you can put this
in your spamassassinuserprefs file

  score razorcheck 

the default score is  and the default threshold needed is 
therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by sa
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 
would be sufficient

if you are already using sa then the above would be more efficient
otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice once
for sa and once again afterward  if you really want to run razor
individually then you should set the score razorcheck  so that sa
wont do it and avoid the double network hit

however one of the benefits of using sa in combination with razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database  the
current score of  is hefty but not enough by itself to tag as spam
but for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold
razor addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as razor
