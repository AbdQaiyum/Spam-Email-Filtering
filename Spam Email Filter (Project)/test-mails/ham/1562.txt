i installed spamassassin  with razor v the other day and it has 
been working great i decided to add pyzor last night and i got that 
installed successfully i think no errors i am using spamd and i see 
where it periodically spawns off a pyzor process however nothing has 
been detected as spam by pyzor under spamassassin it has been running 
for almost half a day now on a  user mail server  so to me the 
odds of something being caught by it should be high i run spamd as 
follows

spamd d h

and all my users home directories have a pyzor directory with the 
server listed under it

i setup a test procmail recipe that just invokes pyzor check and not 
spamc to see if in fact pyzor alone catches any spam   i just set this 
up so no results yet here is what i get when i check connectivity to 
the pyzor server

 pyzor d ping
sending user anonymousntime nsig 
cacfbbcdedffceafnnop pingnthread npv

work spamassassin team
