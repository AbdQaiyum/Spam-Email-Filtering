 guys the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with
 spammers while were getting judgments against them and especially in
 other countries where those judgments are harder to get

my concern doesnt stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work  my concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam

 please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
 regular spammers  yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
 pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but
 the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles
 so i cant understand how daniel can assert that you cant track
 spammers down when its never really been tried

please dont misquote me  i did not assert that you cant track
spammers  here is what i said

 it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone in
 various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a good
 example even if they do officially respect copyright law

i understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox  it is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a  score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam

 daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself
 on your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to
 only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all
 violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will
 quickly remove us from the next release  but youre trying to kill
 habeas before it has a chance to show any promise

i think ive worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a
score  im just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base

i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less aggressive
score one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyones
inbox and after weve seen evidence that the system works then we can
increase the magnitude of the score
