hi 

i upgraded to  now  last week and the messages which are 
definitely in the dcc database arent being marked as such by 
spamassassin when connected to via spamc interestingly it is detected 
when running spamassassin t  samplespamtxt using the same userid 
incidentally is this a known feature of spamc under x or is there 
anything obvious that i am not implementing correctly note that as i 
implied above this used to work under x of spamassassin and 
spamdspamc

regards
