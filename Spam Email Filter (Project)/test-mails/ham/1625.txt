the current fromendsinnums triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits  i think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits so that rules with different so ratios can
get different scores  so ive made test rules that look from from
names that end with two three four or five digitis and one for six or
more digitis i also put in a test rule that looks for froms that end in a
single digit just the sake of completeness

here is what i got

overall   spam nonspam     so    rank   score  name
                         all messages
                    all messages as 
                        tfromendsinnums
                        tfromendsinnums
                       tfromendsinnums
                        tfromendsinnums
                       tfromendsinnums
                        tfromendsinnums

i should note that i get rather bad sos for fromendsinnums probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of yahoo groups traffic which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names  here is the normal stats for fromendsinnums

                       fromendsinnums

and my stats
