   just cvs uped and nowadays catchup unseen is extremely slow on 
   large  msgs unseen sequences anybody else having this problem
  
  ill take the blame
  
  the reason i suspect is that were needlessly reading the sequences file 
  multiple times because of other sequences  i need to make the code much 
  smarter about handling that file but first i have a few other fish to fry in 
  my rather large patch thats on its way
  
 
 no panic
 
 im all for cleaning things up before getting it optimized

okay this fix is now checked in
