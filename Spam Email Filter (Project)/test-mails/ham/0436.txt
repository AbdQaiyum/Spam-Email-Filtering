 microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows
 they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a
 service pack  somehow i cant imagine them removing the ability to
 run c programs
they removed their java vm they didnt remove the ability to run java
programs
anybody is free to develop their own java vm and make it kick ass as
someone said earlier in the thread nobody is capable or willing to do that

ive done a bunch of java and havent run into huge problems running the
same bytecode across solaris or wink
what actual problems have people actually run into actually
