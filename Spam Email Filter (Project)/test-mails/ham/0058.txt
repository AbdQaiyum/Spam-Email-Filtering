political mail the snail kind doesnt bother me  i like it a lot of the 
time because as crap as it is at least its not the kind of info you get 
on tv  particularly for small time local politics its the best way to 
get information

but what matters is that mail is speech and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech  spam is the tool for
dissident news since the face that its unsolicited means that recipients
cant be blamed for being on a mailing list
