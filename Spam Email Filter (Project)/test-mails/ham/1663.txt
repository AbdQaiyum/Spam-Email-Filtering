  you might be better asking this on the spamassassintalk list  the folks 
  there will almost definitely have an answer for this
 
 i posted a fairly lengthy complete answer to this problem and how to
 get around it in sa  on the spamassassintalk list 

thanks for the post there it answered all my questions about
spamassassinrazor interaction

now for a razor question

im worried about having a server full of razoragentlog files which keep
on growing  is it possible to configure razor log via syslog to make it
easy to rotate logs  searching through the man pages didnt turn anything
up  otherwise ill have to write a script to go through each users home
directory looking for razoragentlog files to rotate periodically

thanks
dave
