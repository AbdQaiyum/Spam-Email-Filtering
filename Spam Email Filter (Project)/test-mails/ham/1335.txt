     i have a fresh new  install  id like to go alsa but i worry
     about screwing it up  is this fear founded  if i could get alsa i
     could run a bunch of games ive been waiting for years to come
     outlike search  rescue available on a mandrake rpm and maybe
     flightgear flight simulator

well im sure you can recompile those game packages without alsa anyway
also note that alsa x has just appeared in mandrake  and that all
previous mandrake releases were using the incompatible aging and now
unsupported x series unless ive misunderstood

     how much hacking is likely required to make it work for an
     sbliveemuk soundcard

near to none it should be quite straightforward 
httpfreshrpmsnetdocsalsa

the only tricky part is editing the etcmodulesconf file but the alsa
soundcard matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
most of the time simply copy and paste

i really think that with my alsa packages alsa on red hat linux has never
been so easy
