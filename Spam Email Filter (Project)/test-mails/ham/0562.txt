    j   they arent selling the software which is pretty pricy as
    j it happens  they are using it to optimize next generation
    j wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a
    j large scale  there are an essentially infinite number of metro
    j wireless configurations some of which generate far more dead
    j or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to
    j operate due to backhaul transit considerations or both  this
    j software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage
    j and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is
    j tied into fiber at multiple points

so you only need to map a handful of metropolitan areas

    j or at least investors find this capability very sexy and
    j compelling

ah  now that i will believe 

dont mind me im just getting even more cynical in my old age
