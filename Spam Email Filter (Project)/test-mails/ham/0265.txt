hello folks
im new to linux so here goes
ive been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem
ive got debian with kernel 
ive got this winmodemyes i know and managed to locate a proper driver
for it
minicom is very much able to dial out
but there seems to be a problem with my pppd installation
when i type ppp in the minicom terminal all i get after the initial info
of my dynamic ip etc is a  and then the no carrier signal
then i looked into calling pppd directly using chat
i used this command  pppd call provider where provider is some script
somewhere
it dials it connects it sends my username  password and when connection
is established it gives the sighup signal and exits
this is confirmed when me friend and i tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttys  i ran pppd waiting for a connection me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did pppd exited

some expert help would be greatly appreciated as im sick and tired of
having to reboot get into windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
linux mounting this drive to get that file etc  itd be nice never have
to go back to windozeexcept for games that is

thanks a million
carlos
