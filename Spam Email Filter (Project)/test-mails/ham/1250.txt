just got this  i was just reading mail but in a very dark
room where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from
the laptop screen   i think i put my fingers on the wrong keys
i mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh

this is from todays cvs the fixes for the problems i mentioned
yesterday are included  i eventually managed to contact the cvs
server

expected integer but got 
    while executing

ps i have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal and the
colours from the ftoc stuff all deleted and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look   i still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer listboxes seem to have some strange habits
and then i need to make it all optional and parameterized at the minute
im just embedding stuff in the code much quicker for prototyping  once
its done ill send a patch for someone to look over
