      anyway i have returned to redhat  on my root filesystem saved my
      home directories music and games on other partitions and while i
      have the  stuff in the list everything i want to upgrade requires
       rpms

   yeah but i try to take it easy on your server  the golden rule of the internet when you find a free resource dont pissem off    i really appreciate your work you get done the things i wish i could and i respect that

 anyway although id easily recommend upgrading x to  using apt i
 wouldnt for x to  as they are c binary incompatible and apt is
 entirely written in c and dynamically linked 

    ok ill search for the isos on the  one remaining site that isnt hammered  
 
 still that doesnt explain a core dump 

    sure this is a linking issue right  right now im still purevanilla  i have the stock version of rpmrpmlibpoptetc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me  no waittheres no new code getting loaded  i dont know either  its been a long day

      whats the inside secret here or do i just start searching mirrors
      for the iso and get over it
 
 why search theres more than enough to choose from here

   the hunt continues with a new field  actually i checked there yesterday but its worth another shot

    thanks
