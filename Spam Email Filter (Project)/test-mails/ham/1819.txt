 id prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i
 tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my
 corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping
 is included in the what about html comment block  but as the
 comment block also says

  xxx so if another way is found to slash the fn rate the decision here
  xxx not to strip html from htmlonly msgs should be revisited

 and weve since done several things that gave significant fn rate
 reductions  i should test that again now

i did so  alas stripping html tags from all text still hurts the fn rate
in my test data

last time i tried this see tokenizerpy comments the fn rate after
stripping tags ranged from  to  with a median of about 
so weve made tons of progress on the fn rate since then  but the mere
presence of html tags still remains a significant clue for clpy traffic
so im left with the same comment

  xxx so if another way is found to slash the fn rate the decision here
  xxx not to strip html from htmlonly msgs should be revisited

if we want to take the focus of this away from clpy traffic i cant say
what effect html stripping would have i dont have suitable test data to
measure that on
