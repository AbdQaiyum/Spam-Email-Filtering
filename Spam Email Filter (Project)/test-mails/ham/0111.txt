if i have any rpms in

httpwwwdudexnetrpms

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package be it known i am not selfish 

i found stuff i thought would later get popular so i would not have to maintain the
rpms for them after they hit the big time gnumpd is an exapmple of this

so if anyone is psyched go for it if so let me know so i can get the rpms from
you in the future


thats angle as in geometry
