 i remember aptget distupgrading from  to  fine so it should 
 work maybe 

ive done that too on many production servers the only little
unimportant catch is to replace kernelheaders by glibckernheaders
a simple aptget install glibckernheaders taking care of that

upgrading between releases is meant to work not between betas or beta and
releases the reason is simple  some packages may have been downgraded
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies for both these categories of packages the upgrade through
aptrhnwhatever just wont do as some older packages might be considered
as the newest thus being kept on the system

as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc
and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll
probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system
