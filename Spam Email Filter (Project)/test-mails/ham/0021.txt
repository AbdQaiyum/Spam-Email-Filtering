 hmm if i didnt trust our government and secret police i could 
look at
 this another way

there is a bit of circumstantial evidence  apparently some mt 
listers were approached by him via email  a little research in 
dejanewsgoogle groups showed a number of messages from him clearly 
hoping to contact girls appearing in altteens and similar groups 
 i just tried a google groups search on robert moaby and some of 
them came top of the list

note for marie  mt stands for mark thomas a slightly slimmer uk 
version of your michael moore  the mailing list is named after him
