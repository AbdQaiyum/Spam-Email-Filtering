slaughter in the name of god
by salman rushdie
friday march   page a washington post

the defining image of the week for me is of a small childs burned and 
blackened arm its tiny fingers curled into a fist protruding from the 
remains of a human bonfire in ahmadabad gujarat in india the murder 
of children is something of an indian specialty the routine daily 
killings of unwanted girl babies    the massacre of innocents in 
nellie assam in the s when village turned against neighboring 
village    the massacre of sikh children in delhi during the 
horrifying reprisal murders that followed indira gandhis assassination 
they bear witness to our particular gift always most dazzlingly in 
evidence at times of religious unrest for dousing our children in 
kerosene and setting them alight or cutting their throats or 
smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length 
of wood

i say our because i write as an indian man born and bred who loves 
india deeply and knows that what one of us does today any of us is 
potentially capable of doing tomorrow if i take pride in indias 
strengths then indias sins must be mine as well do i sound angry 
good ashamed and disgusted i certainly hope so because as india 
undergoes its worst bout of hindumuslim bloodletting in more than a 
decade many people have not been sounding anything like angry ashamed 
or disgusted enough police chiefs have been excusing their mens 
unwillingness to defend the citizens of india without regard to 
religion by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to 
the same sentiments as the nation in general

meanwhile indias political masters have been tuttutting and offering 
the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control 
it has escaped nobodys notice that the ruling party the bharatiya 
janata party bjp or indian peoples party and the hindu extremists 
of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council are sister 
organizations and offshoots of the same parent body even some 
international commentators such as britains independent newspaper 
urge us to beware excess pessimism

the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that were used 
to it it happens every so often then it dies down thats how life is 
folks most of the time india is the worlds largest secular democracy 
and if once in a while it lets off a little crazy religious steam we 
mustnt let that distort the picture

of course there are political explanations ever since december  
when a vhp mob demolished a yearold muslim mosque in ayodhya which 
they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram hindu 
fanatics have been looking for this fight the pity of it is that some 
muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the 
trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic echoes 
of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the 
partition riots of  played right into the hindu extremists hands

the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and 
insufficient radicalism of indias bjp government prime minister atal 
bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a 
coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjps 
more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together 
but it isnt working anymore in state elections across the country the 
bjp is being trounced this may have been the last straw for the vhp 
firebrands why put up with the governments betrayal of their fascistic 
agenda when that betrayal doesnt even result in electoral success

the electoral failure of the bjp is thus in all probability the spark 
that lit the fire the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the 
site of the demolished ayodhya mosque  thats where the godhra dead 
were coming from  and there are reprehensibly idiotically 
tragically muslims in india equally determined to resist them vajpayee 
has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and 
wrongs of the ayodhya issue the vhp is no longer prepared to wait

the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi in a letter to indias 
president k r narayanan blames the gujarat government led by a bjp 
hardliner as well as the central government for doing too little too 
late she pins the blame firmly on the motivated wellplanned out and 
provocative actions of the hindu nationalists but another writer the 
nobel laureate v s naipaul speaking in india just a week before the 
violence erupted denounced indias muslims en masse and praised the 
nationalist movement

the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced and mahasveta devi in 
her letter demands stern legal action against them but the vhp is 
determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such 
public pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting 
them naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces 
the nobel award

the political discourse matters and explains a good deal but theres 
something beneath it something we dont want to look in the face 
namely that in india as elsewhere in our darkening world religion is 
the poison in the blood where religion intervenes mere innocence is no 
excuse yet we go on skating around this issue speaking of religion in 
the fashionable language of respect what is there to respect in any 
of this or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around 
the world in religions dreaded name how well with what fatal results 
religion erects totems and how willing we are to kill for them and 
when weve done it often enough the deadening of affect that results 
makes it easier to do it again

so indias problem turns out to be the worlds problem what happened in 
india has happened in gods name the problems name is god
