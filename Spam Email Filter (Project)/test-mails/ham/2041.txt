eddie kessler describes programming at napster 

ray ozzie has more on platforms finding the right price point for a 
software platform is critical to me this sounds like a fancy way of saying 
i groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous 
but i cant bring myself to do it the price ray says must be high enough 
both  to maintain a perception of value in the platform and  to create 
significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is 
assured of the platforms ultimate viability what he doesnt mention if you 
lower the price on the only product youre selling you have a revenue hit 
which will not make your investors happy and you may run out of money and have 
to close but that must be what hes thinking
