opening arguments are set to begin early next month in eldred vs ashcroft
a landmark us supreme court case that will decide the future of copyright
law including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others



to heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an internet
bookmobile is set to depart san francisco next monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the supreme court building in washington dc
before arguments wrap up the van which will be stopping at schools
libraries and senior centers along the way is equipped to provide free
highspeed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain



i had the opportunity to visit the internet archive about a month ago and
saw the bookmobile under construction its a neat idea take an suv put a
small satellite dish on the top and put a computer printer and binding
machine in the back voila  people can search for a book then print out a
copy right there on the spot quite literally ondemand printing total
fixed cost of the computerprinterbinding machine if bought new the ia
had the equipment donated is under k

one of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could if
they wished add these virtual holdings public domain materials to their
existing library at a fixed cost most libraries can afford this should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas
