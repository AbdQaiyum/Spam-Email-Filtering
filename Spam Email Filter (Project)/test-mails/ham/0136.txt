heres a weird and wacky problem

im currently out of the country with my trusty evo nc laptop when i 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried bizarre i thought because id 
used it successfully while in the office the only difference was that i 
was trying the thing in the hotel i entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers then rebooted the laptop to windows 
and tried again worked perfectly back to linux still not talking 
considered that it might be flaky power so i ran the laptop on battery 
nope tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux still not working eventually i gave up 
and used the irda port instead  which is usually the serial connection 
of doom grief and teethgrinding

this morning in the office the damn thing is working without a hitch

anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under linux

cheers
