because i get mail through several different email addresses i frequently
get duplicates or triplicates or moreplicates of various spam messages
in saving spam for later analysis i havent always been careful to avoid
saving such duplicates

i wrote a script some time ago to try an minimize the duplicates i see by
calculating a loose checksum but i still have some duplicates  should i
delete the duplicates before training or not  would people be interested in
the script  id be happy to extricate it from my local modules and check it
into cvs

skip
