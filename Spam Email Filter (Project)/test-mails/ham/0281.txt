ft lizard abandoned at resort

holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach
the savannah monitor lizard was captured at chapel st leonards lincs on
sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an rspca team
rspca officer justin stubbs who took the lizard to a specialist carer
said savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldnt
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long
officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing
savannah monitor lizards originate in africa and are carnivorous eating
rats and small rodents they can grow to ft in length
anyone with information about the lizard can contact the rspca in confidence
