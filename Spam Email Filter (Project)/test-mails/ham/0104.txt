 spam is the tool for dissident news since the fact that its unsolicited 
 means that recipients cant be blamed for being on a mailing list
 

russell turpin
 that depends on how the list is collected or
 even on what the senders say about how the list
 is collected better to just put it on a website
 and that way it can be surfed anonymously and
 it doesnt clutter my inbox

it doesnt work that way  a website is optin spam is noopt  if you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble  if you get samizdat spam
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it  and as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didnt optin like party
officials then other recipients cant get in trouble for requesting the
mail  

plus its much harder to block spam than web sites

but this shouldnt come as a surprize  spam is speech  it may be sleazy 
but so what
