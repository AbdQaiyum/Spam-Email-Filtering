   mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the
   context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called
 
 in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify time
 but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
 check their date stamp you could just read them again

do you really think this is true  i added a modify time check thinking that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a lot more times in 
the new code because were trying to use the sequences

on the other hand the sequences files are probably being read out of cache 
when that happens anyway

even with a small file id think that the time taken to do a 
file mtime filename would be worth it  my code is in proc mhreadseqs
