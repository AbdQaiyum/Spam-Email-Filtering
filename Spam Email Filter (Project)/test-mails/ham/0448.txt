   hmmm i assume youre going to report this to the nmh folks

yes i will sometime after i look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break and why

but we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist dont we   the patch to have exmh do the right thing whether this
bug exists or not is trivial so id suggest including it

patch follows 

i have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before not that it should make any difference to nmh or mh   but since
i stopped doing that the variable msgs isnt really needed any more
rather than assigning pickmsgs to msgs and then using msgs the code
could just use pickmsgs where msgs is now used   this is just a
frill though so i didnt change that
