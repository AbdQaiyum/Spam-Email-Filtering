dan gillmor state needs intelligent energy deregulation

by dan gillmor
mercury news technology columnist

the facts were trade and government secrets at the time but the energy
industry failed the smell test in  and  as it tried to justify
soaring wholesale electricity and naturalgas prices in california

now as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial
and fiscal mess well be cleaning up for decades were learning what
everyone suspected market games helped engineer the price spikes

the latest manipulation was highlighted in mondays finding by a federal
administrative law judge who said a dominant naturalgas company squeezed
supplies in order to squeeze customers his ruling came a few days after
californias public utilities commission reported that electricity
generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch
also driving up prices

and dont forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked
the system in schemes best summed up by an enron insiders boast in a
memorandum made public in may that enron gets paid for moving energy to
relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any
congestion

how much of this was illegal as opposed to simply amoral remains to be
seen unfortunately californias response  confusion lawsuits and
policy tweaks  hasnt been sufficient

more unfortunately even if the state suddenly did all the right things 
including a hardnosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers
grips  we would need a willing federal partner but its foolish to think
that the bush administration would do much to help one of its least
favorite states or do anything that conflicts with its love of
traditional nonrenewable energy sources

if the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any
fruit the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the
state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early  thats a
reasonable approach but dont expect miracles

state policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation meanwhile
instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation  still a good idea if
it gives customers genuine choices  state laws and regulations put the
utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers
notes v john white executive director of the sacramentobased center for
energy efficiency and renewable technologies wwwceertorg

its tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities 
tempting but a bad idea when theres genuine competition as we could
achieve in electricity generation the private sector tends to do a better
job instead of abandoning deregulation california should find a way to
inject real competition into the market

we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity
defies privatization at least under current conditions smart regulation
is essential

but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers
control there are two ways conservation and replacement we need more of
both

the best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up
the use of electricity from renewables by  californias utilities
will have to get  percent of their power from solar and other renewable
sources several power companies are expected to do this even sooner

but this law has an element of oldline thinking the captivecustomer
model we need to be getting away from not sustaining lip service to newer
ideas isnt enough

the state should be removing barriers to microgeneration systems small
generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized
hardertodisrupt electricity to homes and businesses this technology is
coming along fast state policies are not keeping pace

investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all
california should be doing more to encourage this whether through tax
incentives or outright grants in lowincome households california hasnt
done badly on conservation in a general sense and energy customers did
react to last years soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back but its
lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it
altogether

maybe this is all pointless the bush administrations energy policies so
grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil coal and nuclear are
making us all more vulnerable never mind what might happen if the coming
war in iraq goes badly

its pointless to hope for a sane federal policy  a crash program to
drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogenbased energy
system but the largest state one of the worlds major economies in its
own right does have some clout we can hit the ripoff artists where it
hurts and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions maybe next
year
