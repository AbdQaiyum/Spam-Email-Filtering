 lately ive got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower i 
 just decided to check that vs reality and yes speed has left the 
 scene somewhere between the release of  and now
 
 i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder  
 msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably
 
 release  msec
 latest cvs  msec
 
 frankly i think this is getting close to nonacceptable since the 
 user settings hasnt changed
 
 anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared

most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences

im sure it can be tuned a bunch but as im leaving for a vacation on friday 
and have plenty of real work to do i wont be able to do much until i get 
back

i will look at all this when i get back but if you want to check into 
whats slow and fix things while im gone my feelings wont be hurt
