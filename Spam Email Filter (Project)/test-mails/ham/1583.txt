 i thought the  perllocalpod line looked odd is it normal to write
 documentation into the root directory g is there some make parameter o
 r
 environment variable that shouldve been set when i ran make

an issue for razor folks i think

 it seems that by registering that i avoided the error path noted in my previo
 us
 email where dnsnetresolver was called but does not exist in my perl
 hierarchy  heres the new output from sa ans razor
looks good


 question if we use spamassassin on a peruser basis invoked from procmailrc
 
 will each user have to run razoradmin register first is there way to
 register with razor just once per system

if you use spamd with the h option and provide a shared directory for
the razor config files to be written to  rtfm for more details
