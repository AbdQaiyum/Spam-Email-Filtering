recently my incoming mail or spool location moved to another disk
im not quite clear how to reconfigure procmailrcvstoreexmh to accept
mail from the new location

how do you feed procmail not with a forward id guess

how does mail enter your system anyway per fetchmail maybe or direct 
 smtpdelivery or does it just magically hit your spool

lotsa questions

cheers
