  ive rebuilt a new alsaplayer package based on angles one
 
 cool one less package to maintain 
 
 one interesting thing about alsaplayer is that redhats xmms package in rh will
 probably not play mp files but alsaplayer does play mps out of the box
 
 also they are developing rapidly in their cvs and looks like their next version
 of alsaplaer will be pretty cool but i have no idea when it will be ready
 
 
 thats angle as in geometry
