 how were these msgs broken up into the  sets  set in particular is giving
 the other sets severe problems and set blows the fn rate on everything
 its predicting  when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
 as much as a factor of  it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
 the sets were chosen  for example perhaps they were broken into sets by
 arrival time  if thats what you did you should go back and break them
 into sets randomly instead  if you did partition them randomly the wild
 variance across runs is mondo mysterious

they werent partitioned in any particular scheme  i think ill write a
reshuffler and move them all around just in case fwiw im using mh 
style folders with numbered files  means you can just use mh tools to 
manipulate the sets


 for whatever reason there appear to be few of those in brucegs spam
 collection  i added code to strip uuencoded sections and pump out uuencode
 summary tokens instead  ill check it in  it didnt make a significant
 difference on my usual test run a single spam in my set is now judged as
 ham by the other  sets nothing else changed  it does shrink the database
 size here by a few percent  let us know whether it helps you

ill give it a go
