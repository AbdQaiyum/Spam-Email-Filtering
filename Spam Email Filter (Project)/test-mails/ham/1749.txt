 ive got a test set here thats the last  and a bit years email to
 infoekitcom and infoeknocom  its a really ugly set of 
 messages currently broken into  spam  ham  currently
 unclassified these addresses are all over the some different
 ekiteknoisiconnect websites so they get a lot of spam

 as well as the usual spam it also has customers complaining about
 credit card charges it has people interested in the service and
 asking questions about long distance rates c c c lots and lots
 of commercial speech in other words stuff that sa gets pretty
 badly wrong

can this corpus be shared  i suppose not

 im currently mangling it by feeding all parts text html whatever
 else  into the filters as well as both a selected number of headers
 to from contenttype xmailer and also a list of header
 countofheader this is showing up some nice stuff  eg the
 xuidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages

if we ever wink have a shared corpus an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers  ive only made three changes
to grahams algorithm so far well ive made dozens  only three survived
testing as proven winners all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues

 i did have received in there but its out for the moment as it causes
 rates to drop

thats ambiguous  accuracy rates or error rates ham or spam rates

 im also stripping out html tags except for href and src  theres
 so so much goodness in them note that im only keeping the contents of
 the attributes

mining embedded httphttpsftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests not keying off href just scanning for anything that looked
like one that was the single biggest fn improvement ive seen  it
didnt change the false positive rate  so you know whether src added
additional power or did you do both at once
