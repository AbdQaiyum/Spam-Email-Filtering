   what is an example of an anything else that it fails for for you
 
  everything else   i cant even mark text in an exmh message window
  and then paste it into a terminal window the cut buffer seems to be
  completely empty and its previous contents are no longer there
  either

 this is all guess work and may be bogus
 
 are you running gnome  i had similar problems as did several
 coworkers updating my gnome components has fixed it for me and
 others although i cant say exactly which component did the
 trick gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely but it may have been
 something else

indeed i am this workstation is rh with gnome it mostly
works so i hadnt bothered to updated it to 

 in any case i have not seen the problem for quite a while now

so upgrading gnome will fix the problem its not an exmhtktcl
issue
