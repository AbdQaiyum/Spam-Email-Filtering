 and pretty good buffering and speed the only thing going for scsi is

 better scattergather  actually i think there might be a  rpm

its not just krpm the desktop hds have a higher failure rate but i
agree eide has high density and eide hardware raid can offer scsi a
sound beating for reliability performance and storage densityrack units
for the money if designed for it and if people would actually start 
buying it
 
 the other issues are pretty much nonissues using multiple drives and
 controller contention just use many ide channels with extra pci
 cards up to  in some systems and long cable runs just split

there are not all that many hard drives inside an u enclosure airflow
blockage you have to fit in x the number of scsi disks with eide will
soon be a thing of the past due to sata

 storage between nodes  dualport scsi is also a nonissue since it
 is very expensive doesnt work that well in practice because there
 are numerous secondary failure modes for shared disk systems and
 because you still end up with a single point of failure

since rackspace costs dominate and our systems need more or less decent
io were going with u dells with scsi the hard drive prices dont
really make a visible difference given the cost of the iron and the
rackspacemonth plus u dells dont have any space left for lots of eide
drives
