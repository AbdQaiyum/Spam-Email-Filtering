i just finished reading an article about mozilla for saloncom this 
excerpt was rather amusing

it is a good question because in almost every way mozilla is a better 
browser than navigator for example netscapes best new feature tabbed 
browsing  which lets you have several web pages open in the same browser 
window and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name  was in 
mozilla many months ago and the mozilla project that created it called 
multizilla already has an improved version available when asked about this 
yecies of netscape said thats true but the engineer whos working on it 
for mozilla is a netscape employee it was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for netscape 

yes ok i suppose thats true if by netscape employee you really meant 
apple employee and by always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for netscape you meant was done in a weekend for mozilla 
because i thought multizilla was cool 

heres how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened one night i finally 
downloaded an extension called multizilla go check it out on mozdevorg i 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in multizilla called tabbed 
browsing i started doing research and discovered netcaptor a tabbed 
browser that embedded winie 

multizilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the mozilla tree the first was 
a ui flaw namely that at the time it had ripped off netcaptor down to the last 
context menu item the gui was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of netcaptors more obscure 
capabilities like sticky names and tab locking the second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasnt encapsulated cleanly into a widget 

i produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time did it in a 
weekend that removed some of the geekier netcaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other navigator files 
would be minimal once i established that it didnt degrade performance in the 
single tab case i checked it in as an experiment

the response was overwhelming as were the bugs that started being filed so 
much so that at first i wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree i was 
overruled by mozilla which turned out to be a good thing for all i think  
even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side and in the mozilla community netscape still 
didnt get it netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document they 
continued to do so for months simply not getting it it was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in and they didnt know what to make 
of it

only after the press raved about it did netscape really jump on board im sure 
netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking cant you just see it 
now well have a popup manager and a manager to manage the popup manager and 
twentyseven preferences for finegrained control of all aspects of popups 

can you believe how disfunctional netscape is when their engineers say you 
should do this or you should do that they get completely ignored or blown 
off but when cnet says we didnt like this or we didnt like that 
netscape scurries to meet their demands that is simply pathetic
