  i am now relaxed again  and pass this info on probably matthias saou
  himself is dude and some package has hardwired a path in his build
  directory it would be nice to find out which and fix it but i am using
  too many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down
 
 indeed my usual login is dude and has been since long before the big
 lebowsky came out  and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code
 my home directory when being compiled 
 for instance 
 
 dudepython dude strings usrbingentoo  grep dude
 homedude
 dudepython dude strings usrbinxine  grep dude
 homeduderedhattmpxinerootusrsharelocale
 
 these should probably be considered bugs in the programs build process
 especially for xine look at that ill report them upstream ifwhen i
 have some time

this is a standard trap for people building things from source its
generally wise to have a special build environment to avoid these
hassles most likely you have some library loading path in your env an
strace of the app will show it

	theapp   grep dude

personally i have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment logged with script the
prevents this kind of error since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from ones environment for use in the build cc arch
various ld variables this kind of thing is necessary

often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no profile
for building stuff
