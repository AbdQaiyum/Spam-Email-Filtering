 there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are
 planning on making money from the spam

many spammers make money not from response to the spam but from selling
the service of spamming on behalf of someone else  you might track down
whoever paid for the mailing but tracking down the actual sender might be
more difficult and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
they havent stopped the spammer so the benefit is strictly to habeas
not to the recipients of the spam  thats the main problem i have with
the whole scenario my pain habeass gain and those most likely to be
held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers
