     i can cutnpaste from exmhs message display window into spawned
     gvim processes but not into anything else
  
  thats odd  i cut  paste between all kinds of windows exmh into
 
 not so odd this issue came up several weeks ago with no real
 resolution
 
  mozilla xterm another wish script of mine i use for dns tasks but
  that one i guess is to be expected netscape when i used to use it
  but i suppose it and mozilla are the same codebase approx  in fact
  i cant thing of anything it fails for that i have noticed
  
  what is an example of an anything else that it fails for for you
 
 everything else   i cant even mark text in an exmh message window
 and then paste it into a terminal window the cut buffer seems to be
 completely empty and its previous contents are no longer there
 either

   btw talking of spring downunder im in queensland  it almost
   feels like early summer already winters here are dry and warm
   much better than cold wet miserable melbourne   despite some
   recent rain first in months we are already into a drought with
   an elnino on the way it is only going to get worse  the last
   one in the s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
   aussie

this is all guess work and may be bogus

are you running gnome  i had similar problems as did several
coworkers updating my gnome components has fixed it for me and
others although i cant say exactly which component did the
trick gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely but it may have been
something else

in any case i have not seen the problem for quite a while now
