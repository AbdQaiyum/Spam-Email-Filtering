 hi all
 the modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds bps to
 bps but that is no good for txrxing data to the remote server
 as it insists at talking at the speed of treaclebps

it sounds like the flow control is set to xonxoff rather than hardware

 baud   data bits even parity

unusual    n  is more common

 
 i am doing a atz to reset the modem then i send this init string
 
 atfevqxysabcdhikmnprsuy

i think that the at command for hardware flow control is e though this
may vary from modem to modem
