quoting paul linehan plinehanyahoocom

 the point here is that under french law the author can change the
 terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of
 rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long
 where to whom dates and times

the gpl and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work  the other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law eg the required element of privity etc

 in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right
 to change his software back to closed on a whim

no the author has the right to issue additional instances under a
different licence such as a proprietary closed sic licence  

 rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting
 of rights which are not default 
 
 see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to
 be explicitly specified  under french law

the analysis here and elsewhere concerns contract law  this isnt
contract law

this isnt the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject  im sure it wont be the last

 
cheers              the front line of defense against such sophisticated 
rick moen            viruses is a continually evolving computer operating 
ricklinuxmafiacom  system that attracts the efforts of eager software
                     developers   bill gates
