rssflowersalignrighta productive thread on rssdev confronts the 
negativeness about rss  headon this will go someplace interesting  

i left a big hint there in the way the blogchannel module is designed 
patterned after the syndication module designed by the rdf folk in other 
words the place where theyre expressing discomfort with rss  is where they 
can make it their own lead instead of feeling disempowered be powerful  

at one point i saw clearly where the compromise between rss x and  was 
we could have gotten there in early  so instead we get there in late  
so what not a big deal think about how much better it will be when were all 
advocating the same format visualize peace thats basically what i did when 
i did the  spec i know its hard to swallow but swallow anyway if i did 
it you can too
