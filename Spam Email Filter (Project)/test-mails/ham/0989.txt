spam is the tool for dissident news since the fact that its unsolicited 
means that recipients cant be blamed for being on a mailing list

that depends on how the list is collected or
even on what the senders say about how the list
is collected better to just put it on a website
and that way it can be surfed anonymously and
it doesnt clutter my inbox
