hi folks

i have just installed spamassassin  in my postfix mta server

at first i would like to test it just in my email account before 
applying it to the wole site

i configured just as in the install file

	 create a forward
	ifs   exec usrbinprocmail f  exit  user
	 create a procmailrc
	fw
	 usrbinspamassassin c 
			etcmailspamassassinrules

but the spams get trought it untouched when i run it by the hand

cat samplespamtxt  usrbinspamassassin c 
				etcmailspamassassinrules

it does tag it as spam and send me the email

what should i look at

thank you
