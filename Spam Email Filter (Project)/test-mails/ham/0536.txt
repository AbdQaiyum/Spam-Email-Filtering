    j seems that governments do have some power over the
    j web after all

at the  itac roadwork conference peter mansbridge asked the
panel of experts how it might be possible to censor the internet  all
of the panelists laughed except bill buxton  peter asked him if he
knew something the others didnt  bill replied that it was possible
to censor the internet which drew a gasp from the audience all you
need is a global government more draconian than any that has occured
before in history

scientology dmca suits against norwegians legal riaa filetrading
virii bushs homeland insecurity canada using isps as spies riaa
suing prodigy for pp users and having foreign sites barred from the
us france tempers yahoo china ipfilters google  

seems bill didnt know much about how government really works  either
that or theres a smelly similarity between buxtons global big
brother and the us and chinese
