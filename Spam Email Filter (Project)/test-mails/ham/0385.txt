more articles that support my fantasy that irvine is the
center of the universe  weve got the corner on electric
cars fuel cells two types of nobel winning physics
outside the box computer science and lot of creative writers

ucis creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade  some
quotes from the article

   in  newsweek called ucis fiction writing workshop
    the hottest writing program in the country now its
    exponentially hotter thanks only in part to sebolds daring
    and uncannily timely novel 

the novel they are talking about is alice sebolds the
lovely bones which is on the way to the top of the 
ny times bestsellers list  my uncle used to tease me
about uci being a usc graduate from  that nobody
knew who uc irvine was just two states over  in fact
i used to refer to uci as one of the lesser known uc
schools and when i went off to college in  my
relatives told everyone i was off to cal state irvine 
i took a class as an undergrad by one of the departments 
faculty called the art of writing fiction   if there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast  

one of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the notsosure bet but according
to the article the number of uci graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent
