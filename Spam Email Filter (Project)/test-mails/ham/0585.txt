it does but its not the cost that is causing us to shut it down the cost
is a minimum  per year but that only accounts for  people
streaming and playing like  or  songs an hour but we could maybe manage
the  cents per person per  songs

the problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming
start and end times for every song not too hard artist okay title
okay composers a little harder serial number wtf i think there
are a few more things they wanted but honestly programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous this means wed also have to get
all the djs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request vinyl or cds not loaded into the computer its ridiculous and
nearly impossible

we would need someone to sit in the studio  writing down all this info 
which sometimes isnt available like from earlier album that dont have
serial numbers and barcodes then still if only the magic  people
webstream our signal the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average  songs an hour wed be paying  everyday to stream to
those  people so really it does have to do with the internet tax but it
is a few reasons together why we cant do it after their killdate
