hi

this has been hashed over a few times on various lists now i finally got 
around to doing something about it you can now add
rpm httpkotiwelhocompmatilai redhat task to your sourceslist 
and after aptget update you can find out whats available with 
aptcache search task

these are generated directly from compsxml of rh so they contain 
exactly the same packages as youll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time i didnt bother including srpms for these as they are 
rather uninteresting if you want you can regenerate the specs by 
running httpkotiwelhocompmatilaicompstaskcompstaskpy

btw the repository only contains the taskpackages youll need an 
aptenabled mirror of rh in your sourceslist to actually do anything 
with it
