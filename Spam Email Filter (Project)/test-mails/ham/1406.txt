 whitelistfrom yahoogroupscom

 in his spamassassinuserprefs file does that line not in effect
 tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
 yahoogroupscom or is there still checking being done against it  and if

it still gets checked but a negative score is added in  and it doesnt
mean coming in from it means from address is yahoogroupscom
theres a yahoo groups compensation rule in  though 

 the latter what does he need to place in userprefs to cause such mail
 to be ignored  im testing sa here with a few users who happen to be on

ignored completely  you cant do that put in a procmail rule

 yahoogroups lists before deploying it systemwide and although the above
 line has been added to their userprefs files much of their list mail is
 still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
 expect to trigger sa

youd want to either add your own compensation rule or up negatively
the whitelist score
