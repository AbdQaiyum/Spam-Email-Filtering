ill agree that webforms are a pain in the ass however it would seem to 
me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the 
autoform function providing more info than you want to  that and some 
entity would be holding the passport info thus have all that data in the 
first place
personally id never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me if not sellrent out  just think of the ability 
theyd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was 
tracked to you  and thats just the marketing side of it

 whats wrong with doing business over the web  web forms  theres
 promising replacements forms but this is the current state of the
 industry
 
  o you find something that you want to fill out  its a partnership form
    a signup for a web seminar a request for more information anything
  o you start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
    about  minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
    just to get a small piece of information  whitepaper or a callback
    when halfway through you start to wonder if its really worth your
    time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list 
  o pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized
    i was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
    listed the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
    to hit submit but due to the layout the more tag on the second
    row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
    about two dozen third world countries 
  o even worse ever time you hit submit all forms based things complain
    about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
    you to reenter dashes instead of dots
  o when you get something thats not entered right you will go back and
    enter it right but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
    automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
    go back and resent that freaking thing too  finally after all combinations
    of all pulldowns you may get a successful submit
  o you wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation  
  o sometimes like today you wont be able to ever submit anything due
    to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
    is internally nonconflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
    forms submission
 
 whats wrong with this picture  the company is screwing you by wasting
 your time enforcing their data collection standards on you  im sure theres
 someone in that company that would be willing to accept us us usa
 united states u of a america etc and would know exactly which
 freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
 to waste even more time playing web form geography  
 
 im starting to see the light of passport  you want more information  hit
 this passport button  voila  ie and netscape  have preforms sutff
 but i always turn it off because you never know when theres that one field
 that you dont want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
 automatically gets sent ie the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
 average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff  
 
 so if crappy formsbased submission is the state of practice for
 business enablement on the web i cant see this whole data submission
 and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
 working all that well
