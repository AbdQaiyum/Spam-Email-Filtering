 i created a user honeypot and set up an alias to it then i added a
 hidden font color same as background color link to that address at the
 bottom of my html pages the procmailrc file for that user is 
 which will submit the msg to razor then save it locally i set this up about
 a month ago and havent received anything other than some viruses sircam
 on it yet the viruses are rejected at the mta level so theyre not being
 savedreported to razor

fwiw i would now recommend doing this using a user with a procmailrc
instead of a system alias more secure and easier to filter out crud
like bounces virii etc that render a corpus dirty
