  if youre using fetchmail mda spamassassin or the equivlent then
  this change means your current setup will no longer work 
 
 oh well i guess there are other antispam options out there

well a you dont have to upgrade and b what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because spamassassin andbefore doesnt
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesnt
promise to return the proper failure code on diskfull conditions etc

if youre still willing to live with b all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin


binsh
 call this file spamassassinwrapper and chmod x it

echo from  date
sed e from d  spamassassin
echo 
  mail


and then use

fetchmail mda spamassassinwrapper f

and you should be all set
