ive been testing razor invoked from sendmailprocmail and so far it
seems pretty copacetic last nights spam to the list provided a good test
 the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged as
other list members reported

this morning i piped the messages out from pine being careful to use the
raw mode to razorcheck d none of the messages come back as spam even
the spam since folks revoked the false positives i understand why they
would not come up but not the spam itself unless that also was revoked

is this spam just a bad one to test against or is there some setting in
pine or razor that i am missing
