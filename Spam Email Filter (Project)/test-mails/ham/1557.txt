 ever since i set defangmime  all spam that contains html has a badly
 formatted report  i thinkrealize its because the report should be in
 html  is there anyway to get spamassassin to add an html report in
 cases where it is required defangmime 

funny i was in the middle of composing the same message when i saw yours

it would be nice if it sees a header like
contenttype texthtml charsetiso

and defangmime is  it could wrap the report with prepre for ease
of reading

and the same sort of problem seems to occur with base encoded messages
the report is placed inside of the mime boundary
nextpartbeabbe
contenttype textplain charsetiso
contenttransferencoding base

spam  start spamassassin results 

should this not go above probably in its own mime section to make sure
that the attachments dont get destroyed
