 i dont know anything about the kde sound server but id guess 
 your problem is the environment in which procmail runs  you 
 dont say what procmail is running from  in my case for 
 example procmail is run from fetchmail which is run by a cron 
 job

sorry about that
procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
i get
but anyway i found an error message in procmaillog which solved
the problem
the following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now

displaylaptop artsplay soundfile

thanks
