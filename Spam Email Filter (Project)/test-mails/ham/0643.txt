first it was my understanding that they had the food before they
refused to pay  i often have the goods in my possession before i settle
the paycheck

second not being paid for a little food is an awfully big deal in
india  it isnt far from stealing the only food my children have so
ill have to watch them starve  the margin of survival is very very
thin

so yes  in my particular reality distortion field not paying for a
little food in india is akin to a direct act of violence intended to
cause suffering if not death on the victims family  that such an act
triggers a violent response is imho hardly surprising

in other words as far as i could tell the people on the train fired the
first shot

with all of that said i still dont know if this happened or not  nor
do i know for sure that the margin of survival for those muslim vendors
was that thin

 wow  it seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion
 field
 
 if the activists on the train refused to pay for food then the
vendors
 shouldnt give it to them  and the local police force should be
 arresting them  etc
 
 you have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view
 which obviously was in operation with the participants here to think
 that religious differences or not being paid for a little food or
 taunting was even a remote justification for burning a train full of
 people alive

  that may not be true but it would put things in a more interesting
  light  taking food from a small vendor in india and not paying them
is
  trying to starve them
 
  it sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full
of
  activists
 
  im rarely an apologist for muslims anywhere  yet i find my
sympathies
  with the muslims in this case even after they burned the train

 the pity of it is that some
 muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the
 trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic
 
  echoes
 
 of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the
 partition riots of  played right into the hindu extremists
 
  hands
