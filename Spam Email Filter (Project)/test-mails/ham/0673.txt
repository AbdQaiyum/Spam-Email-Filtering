 tuesday september   am est

 french writer tried as antiislam protest erupts
 by caroline brothers

 paris reuters  provocative french novelist michel houellebecq
 faced a paris court on tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
 by calling islam the stupidest religion and its holy book the
 koran a depressing read

 the case brought against him by four muslim groups is a cause
 celebre reminiscent of the salman rushdie affair pitting freedom of
 expression against religious sensitivities

 the muslim groups which include the meccabased world islamic
 league and the paris mosque accuse the writer of insulting islam in
 an interview with the literary magazine lire during last years
 launch of his novel plateforme

 lire is also on trial over the remarks which have taken on an added
 significance in france in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
 and concern about islam following the september  attacks by muslim
 radicals in the united states

 shortly after the trial started  people in the courtroom stripped
 off their shirts to reveal tshirts saying no to the censure of the
 imams and marianne veiled marianne raped  a reference to the
 female symbol of the french republic

 freedom of expression freedom of expression they and other
 houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
 courtroom at the main law courts in central paris

 while intellectuals argued before the trial that houellebecq should
 be free to write what he wants lyon mosque rector kamel kabtan
 retorted we are for freedom of expression but not for insulting
 communities

 bete noire

 houellebecq  the bete noire of contemporary french literature
 is no stranger to controversy he offended conservatives and the
 politically correct left with his  novel les particules
 elementaires atomised in english

 paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur says muslims have been insulted
 once before by houellebecq who had the main character in plateforme
 admit he felt a quiver of glee every time a palestinian
 terrorist was killed

 the world islamic league the lyon mosque and the national
 federation of muslims in france have joined the paris mosque in
 bringing houellebecq to trial

 frances human rights league joined them as a civil party saying
 houellebecqs comments amounted to islamophobia and deserved to be
 sanctioned as part of the leagues struggle against discrimination
 and racism

 the paris mosque has hired jeanmarc varaut one of frances leading
 trial lawyers whose past clients include maurice papon the former
 official condemned in  for naziera crimes against humanity for
 sending jews to death camps

 restoring blasphemy

 houellebecqs lawyer emmanuel pierrat argues that the case
 effectively reestablishes the notion of blasphemy despite the fact
 that france as a secular state has no such law and says
 houellebecqs opponents want to deny him freedom of expression

 he also argues that the interview in lire truncated a sixhour
 conversation and houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
 article before it appeared

 houellebecqs publisher flammarion has distanced itself from the
 author whose comments some say may have cost him frances
 prestigious goncourt prize  for which he had been a contender

 the novelist who lives outside cork ireland writes in a detached
 style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
 love

 translated into  languages atomised incensed frances 
 generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
 him frances november prize in  and the impac award one of the
 worlds biggest fiction prizes

 losing his case may mean a year in jail or a  fine
