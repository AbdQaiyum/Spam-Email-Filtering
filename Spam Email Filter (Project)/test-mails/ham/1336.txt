i really think that with my alsa packages alsa on red hat linux has never
been so easy 

i had been hand building those alsa packages for probably  months or more so i
could use my laptops ess chip best hard disk recording and such wow maybe  to
 months time flys i didnt look forward to doing that tedious build every time i
changed a kernel or something matthias has made this a thing of the past dude
its a no brainer use aptget or just download and install

whats more oss is fully imitated older apps using oss are as happy as a clam
my personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better alsaplayer xmms
with alsa module to my ear

the  things that trick people are the modulesconf file they didnt have that
automatic matrix page when i started with alsa you dont know how good you have it

and on my old installs only the first time i installed it on a clean box alsa
always was muted until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music its possible
matthias even took care of that too anyway it iswas only a one time thing on st
install that was a long time ago for me

those alsa dudes had been trying to get it into the  kernel but missed it but
its been in  for a while now so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel


thats angle as in geometry
