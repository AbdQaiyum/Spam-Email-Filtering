 hmm also i think ive found some cases where its hitting on fetchmail
 received hdrs  thats bad  so it could be fixed

fetchmail adds received headers  that seems wrong  ill open a bug
to investigate  can you attach some examples

 yeah will do  somehow  pity the bugzilla doesnt allow email
 submissions

agreed  at least you can add information with email
