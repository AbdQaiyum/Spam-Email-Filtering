i received a spam email that had apparently forged the from header with
my own email address after reviewing the message i forwarded it with
the rest of a batch of spam ti the database with razorreport now of
course my own email address is listed int he razor database how do i
go about getting it removed

i have seen this ploy forged from headers several time since then
perhaps the razorreport need to detect this and emit a warning
