feedback from my posting about fogbugz setup fell into four categories 

why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a 
couple of things to understand here first of all even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end theres always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail and in that case a wellbehaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done there are well over  error 
messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant 

second its not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake for example early in the fogbugz setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use

screenshot 

the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account for example the password might 
not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of 
windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha 
didnt know that its better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account otherwise youve left 
their system in an indeterminate state 

in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where i can display a useful error message 

and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well in order to 
upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we never ever require a 
reboot we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping fogbugz files pinned down such as iis microsofts web server so 
part one of the batch is stop iis now if part  fails for some reason it 
would be extremely rude to leave iis not running and anyway its not like i 
dont need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the 
code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal i just need to 
call it at the right place 

i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then 
do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow this is a polite way to waste less of the users time indeed even 
fogbugz setup does  of its work at the very end but the create account 
operation is so fast that principle simply doesnt apply here even our  of 
the work phase takes well under a minute most of which is spent waiting for 
iis to stop and start 

why did you use vcmfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that delphi is more productive first of all leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed 
to figure out in high school that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring  

secondly even if delphi were more productive the only pertinent question 
since i am writing the code is what is more productive for joel spolsky and 
i dont know delphi at all but i know win mfc and vc really really 
well so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer i would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me 
certainly over a short  week project third many of the things i needed to do 
in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to 
an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt what you 
find is about  c code maybe  vb code and  everything else yes i 
know i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated 
delphi programmer not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer but that 
costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language and fourth i already had about  of the 
code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz  setup and a library 
ive been using for years to make wizards 

why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup 
programs dont increase sales this was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons 

 decreased tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code 
 delight my customers when im trying to get them to upgrade to  i want 
them to remember how painless the  installation was so they wont hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade im still using an old version of 
spamassassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective even though i know the 
new version is much better because i just cant bear the thought of another 
morning wasted the very memory of the first spamassassin installation  all 
the little ssh windows some sued trying to scroll through man pages and 
google groups accidentally hitting ctrlz in emacs to undo and having it 
suspend trying to guess why we cant get the mta to run procmail sorry its 
too much if spamassassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they dont have a setup program 
 win reviews software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and th century philosophers they always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to pc games 
mainframe databases web site auction software and dna sequencing 
software and setup is always on their list a single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say aha


how can we make wise better kudos to the product manager of wise 
installation system for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasnt adequate for typical iisaspsql applications
