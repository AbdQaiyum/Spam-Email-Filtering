 its  untested although the build should be ok the new menu was
 added but some configuration files may be better with new or different
 defaults
 
 feedback is very welcome

it works very nice would you consider upgrading it to  released only a
few hours after your build

thanks

 im pleased to announce the availability of nessus  which should
 be one of the last versions of nessus x hopefully as i will soon
 open a new unstable tree and start to break things again 
 
 what is new in nessus  in comparison to  
 
  changes by michael slifcak michaelslifcak at guardentcom
       added bugtraq cross reference in the plugins
       added support for bid in nessusd this has yet to be done on
        the client side
        
  changes by axel nennker axelnennker at tsystemscom
       fixed the xml and html outputs
       fixed array issues in a couple of plugins
      
  changes by michel arboi arboi at bigfootcom
       findservice now detects services protected by tcp wrappers
        or acl
       findservice detects gnuserv
       ptyexecvp replaced by nessuspopen 
      
  changes by renaud deraison deraison at cvsnessusorg
       fixed a bug which may make nasl interpret backquoted strings
        n and r received from the network problem noted by pavel
        kankovsky
       nmapwrappernes calls exit instead of exit 
       solved the lack of bpfs on freeopennetbsd and macosx by
        sharing one among all the nessus processes as a result
        nessuss ping is much more effective on these platforms
       bugfix in plugsetkey which would eventually make some
        scripts take too long when writing in the kb
       plugins of family actsettings are run after plugins of
        family actscanners
       replaced the implementation of md which was used when
        openssl is disabled by the one from rsa the old one would
        not work on a bigendian host
       fixed plugins build issues on macos x
       the nessus client compiles and links against gtk of
        course it will be horrible and unstable as the gtk team
        does not care about backward compatibility
   
  these two modifications solve the problems of nmap hanging under freebsd
 
 
 
 special thanks go to michael slifcak whose work on nessus during the
 last months have been truly appreciated even if they have not always
 been as underlined as they should have been michael thanks again 
 
 
 availability
 
 nessus  is available at httpwwwnessusorgposixhtml
