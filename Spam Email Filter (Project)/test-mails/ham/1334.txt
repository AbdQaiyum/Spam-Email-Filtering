although it looks like im replying to myself i just havent gotten
matthias reply yet although i can see it on the website and i did
subscribe but probably to the digest

anyway matthias wrote
 once upon a time steve wrote 
 
  i did aptget update and it seemed to have gotten the new packages
 
 hmmm it seems check closer as this may be where the problem is
 coming
 from
  but doing things like aptget install synaptic didnt work neither
  did other known packages like aptget install lame
  
  i just get
  rootcanarsievarcacheapt  aptget install lame
  reading package lists done
  building dependency tree done
  e couldnt find package lame
 
 could you double check what aptget update does and eventually post
 the
 output if there are any errors or messages you dont understand

ok i did it again and heres what i got
rootcanarsietmp  aptget update

so it looks like it worked and the files are updated  very strange  

maybe something went wrong updating apt from my old version as used
with rh and this one  lemme try totally uninstalling and
reinstalling it
