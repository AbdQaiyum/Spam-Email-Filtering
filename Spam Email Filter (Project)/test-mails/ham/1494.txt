i recently installed razor v and started using it  i am finding it
necessary to whitelist a lot of mailing lists  some such as yahoogroups
i cant whitelist because the from address is the person making the post
so i will have to whitelist on another field when i can modify my code to do
so  i wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions or if
these are bad mailing lists that dont drop bad mail addresses that become
trollboxes in time

any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligible
to become a trollbox  i figure after three years of bounced mail the list
should have figured out they arent here any more
