after a bit of peeking through the exmh tcl and playing with tcl a bit i got 
the catchup unseen messages before cur procedure working  heres the code 
for everybody and the list archives in case anyone wants it in the future  
thanks to john r loverso for putting me on the right track  

proc mymarkcurseen  
    global exmh pick msg
    set results 
    exmhstatus clearing unseen up to cur red
    mhsetcur exmhfolder msgid
    set unseen mhunseen exmhfolder
    foreach elem unseen 
         if  elem  msgid  
            lappend results elem
         
    
    set pickids results
    busy pickmarkseen
    exmhstatus ok blue


if you want to use this stick it in your tkexmh directory run automkindex 
on it and add the following lines to your exmhexmhdefaults
fopsmoremuentrylist        ketchup
fopsmoremlketchup         catchup all before current
fopsmoremcketchup         mymarkcurseen
