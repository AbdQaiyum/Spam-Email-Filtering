the doe has announced a highspeed datatransfer that runs on drillpipe 
through a inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to  atmospheres temperatures up to  deg c and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of gs 

    now with a highspeed bidirectional communications link a drilling 
    systems azimuth inclination pressure temperature loads and vibration 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit can be 
    evaluated almost instantly also because of the ability to send highspeed 
    data through the drill pipe technologies once thought unobtainable  such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit  may now be possible 

    with highresolution seismic data collected ahead of the bit operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil and gasbearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas this will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir
