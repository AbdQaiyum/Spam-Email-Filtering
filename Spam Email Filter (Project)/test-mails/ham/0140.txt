is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmaileircomnet

ive been reading the emails using the web based interface but ive
reached my quota limit there doesnt seem to be any way to get the
emails off the server i can connect to the account using pop but that
only retrieves unread emails theres also no way to mark emails as
unread from the html interface

is there a way i can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
the emails and remove them off the server

its been years since ive used fetchmail i dont recall be able to do
this

any other suggestions welcome theres a few hundred email so i dont
fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account
