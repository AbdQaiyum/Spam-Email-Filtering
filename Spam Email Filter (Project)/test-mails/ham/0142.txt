it seems to only support pppoa and not pppoe you need one that supports
pppoe if you want torun it in routed ip mode if you are using it as a
bridge itll probably work but youd be left leaving the computer on
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router

the best router ive come accross is the zyxel  eircom supply this
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from america or the uk

hope this is useful
