  ah  the mixer stuff was what made me look for an init script in the
  first place i didnt bother to check whether the existing stuff would
  have worked with that  will try that out you can assume silence 
  success 
 
 well from what ive tried both the main and the pcm at least volume
 levels can be controlled either by alsamixer or the good old aumix

cool ill try it out as well as the new rpms tomorrow

   from what i can tell after only  days using it  alsa rocks
   especially
   since having a full oss compatibility results that it breaks nothing at
   all 
  
  agreed  though with only  hours experience
 
 i guesshope some other people from the list will try it out 
 
 both problems you reported libasoundso and wrong xine dependency are now
 fixed in the current packages

thanks that was quick
