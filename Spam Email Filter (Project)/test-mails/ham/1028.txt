 i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder  
 msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably
 
 release  msec
 latest cvs  msec

im not seeing a hit on next a quick just pound on next and watch the
wall clock test shows me able to go through  messages in under  seconds
so its well under ms per switch but im seeing a really piggy cpu spike
 for a few seconds in the flist code  of course it seems to be
related to numberoffolders

 wc mailfolders
              mailfolders

its particularly annoying because things just hoseandhang for  seconds so
when it hits you have a long latency before what youre doing actually
happens

and it takes a hit even if theres no new mail

im perfectly willing to canopener that code and see where the cpu is
going but only if nobody is slapping their forehead and mumbling about
a brownpaperbag bug
