i knew itd be a day for insanity

so anyway newscom decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
dmca and decided to link to decssexe the very verboten code that
ended up getting  but none of the other news services that
originally linked spanked

slashdot of course links to them

so now i link to slashdot

httpslashdotorgarticlesshtmltid

i find this all incredibly funny really  congress and the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the dmca are
applied  for the most part these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be how nefarious the defendant party is and how
asleep the judge is behind the case asleepselfinterestedbought
its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer thats for sure
