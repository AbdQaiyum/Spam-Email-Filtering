right now we have one spam status flag indicating that a message is or
is not spam the idea being that the end user perhaps make a rule that
would move the spam flagged messages into a spam folder and thus gain
some time by presorting messages into to piles


 if you people dont know enough to filter on the actual score theyve got
the stars which will give them more than enough levers if they want it

sure  we developers know that  but what im talking about is making it 
easier for end users to figure out
