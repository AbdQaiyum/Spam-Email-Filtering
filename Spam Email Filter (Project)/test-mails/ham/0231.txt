 i took a bit of time to review what is on the above url  if i were a news

 the wheel is already patented in australia melbourne man patents the wheel

 the sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents pending or not
thats for very basicgeneral ideas its the current form of domainnapping
and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents
