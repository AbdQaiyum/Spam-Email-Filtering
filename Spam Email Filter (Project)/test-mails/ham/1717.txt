  ive been testing razor invoked from sendmailprocmail and so far it
  seems pretty copacetic last nights spam to the list provided a good test
   the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged as
  other list members reported
 

     are you using spamassassin on the input side  ive just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the proper way to pass it through there systemwide before accepting it and sending it to the users  its kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user when the users home directories are nfs mountedand the source is on my own machine on which i try new things and its the only machine with the drivespace


ive not used spamassassin on the kiss principle i just have procmail
adding an xheader and optionally modifying the subject if razorcheck
comes back positive
