hello all
firstly id like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that i got to my question today  i have one more question though  i
downloaded the w and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that i received today  then though i tried to build them  i
started by trying the w program  i used the following lines which produced
some strange results  would any one be able to set me straight

configure withemacs prefixusrlocalsrcbetaw execprefixusr
localsrcbetaw withurlurlurl
that worked fine so i moved to the next step
make
at the bottem of the text i got the following messages
cannot open load file urlurlurlvarsel
make  customloadel error 
make leaving directory usrlocalsrcbetawlisp
make  w error 

when i got around to trying the url package i had no problems  in saying
that this doesnt necessarily mean that i was doing it right so below are
the commands i used
configure withemacs prefixurlurl execprefixurlurl
followed by the commands make and make install
there is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
im not completely certain if ive used the right method here

thanks again

darragh

subject ot re ilug newby to linux looking for information on cvs



 speaking of that ide weblogic developer the open source version called
 eclipse is free from eclipseorg if you are doing java development you
 need to get this ide  ive been using it for the last month and it is
 absolutly superb best thing about it is that rather than using swing
 which is crap is that they have their own native widget set called swt

 when you run it on windows it uses windows widgets but when you run it on
 linux it uses gtk you should see it on gnome   absolutely stunning

 this is the best step by step guide to setting up cvs on redhat


httpwwwbsoftwareibmcomwsddlibrarytecharticlesyuyuhtmlopen
 ltgr

 it is for a particular ibm ide but the setup and testing of the server is
 the same for any cvs client

 both the using linux and linux in a nutshell book by oreilly have
 sections on cvs rcs  and both books are a must buy for any linux newbie

   hello
   i am very new to linux and need some help on a utility called
  cvs  as far
   as im aware its a similar protocol to ftp  i need to use it
  to download a
   program from pserveranoncvssubversionsgnuorgcvsrootw
  i am looking
   for information on how to use it  ill have another look at
  the man pages
   but i think i have to set it up before i can download anything
  cvs is really a very different kind of thing to ftp but the details of
  that statement are left as an exercise to the reader wont show up my
  own ignorance that way 
  the application you want is cvsclient
  there is documentation here
  httpwwwfokusgmddegnudocscvscvsclienttochtml
 
  you might get a quick idea of how it works from here
  httpwwwscimuniczmikulikgnuplothtml
  where he explains how to get cvs gnuplot
  the commands are
 
  export
  cvsrootpserveranonymouscvsgnuplotsourceforgenetcvsrootgnuplot
  cvs login
  cvs z checkout gnuplot
 
  something similar will probably do the job for you  im guessing the
  following might work
 
  export cvsrootpserveranoncvssubversionsgnuorgcvsrootw
  cvs login
  cvs z checkout w
