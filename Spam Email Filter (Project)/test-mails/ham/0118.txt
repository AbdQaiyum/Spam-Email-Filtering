this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c then c and
moved on to java and i think that

looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive yours is
anecdotal they dont know what theyre talking about


  the people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programming
language you write things in they just want it to work

in my experience they do care  it has to work certainly and in
particular it has to work with what theyve already got and it has to
work on clients systems

my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on
linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and havent come back yet

microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows
they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a
service pack  somehow i cant imagine them removing the ability to
run c programs


  c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again

cant say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
issues apart from the fact that i frequently need   gb


its about design patterns architecture high level stuff

if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve
then its trivial anyway irrespective of language


i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low
level problems that have been solved  million times over and over
and over again

you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time
on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont  depends
entirely on the programmer not the language


  java is not just a programming language its also a platform

buzzword


a monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicing
and dicing the same problems  different ways

unsupported assertion


  if you have a program of any type of high complexity written in c you
cant possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
the same magnitude of cost as java

dunno  eg i ported a wee line c program to darwin on powerpc
in a few minutes yesterday  sure if it was badly designed it would be
 times the size and harder to port  if it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder  portable code is easy to port
at least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform i also run on arm systems with no proper java


  makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person java imho reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer java as it is
to reverse engineer c large applications

you can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum

 
  hardware is getting so fast that im not sure if the performance
difference between java and cc are relevant any more

whoah  performance matters to me every day  right now im taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run  sure i could
wait  years until everyones pc is fast enough to generate random ecs
in no time when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors
or i can do it now when very few people can

 
the end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved

yes


and for those problems languages such as java smalltalk and others
allow you to think more high level than low level  thinking of bits
and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important
problems

its true  i admit everything  mea maxima culpa  working in c makes
me spend all day thinking base rank thoughts about hardcore bitography
not

actually i spend most of my time thinking in highlevel mathematics


why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems
over and over again 

dunno and frankly i dont see the relevance to the issue at hand


im sure java is fine for some stuff as is c or whatever  horses for
courses
