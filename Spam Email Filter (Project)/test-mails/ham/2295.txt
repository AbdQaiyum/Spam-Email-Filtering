the new ish of strange horizons in out with an interview with bloodhag the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands 

    soon the spotlight comes up again the lead singer grabs the microphone 
    this is frank bellknap long he yells and feverish launches into a 
    lecture on longs oeuvre there cant be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beersodden thrash crowd to listen to an english 
    lit lecture thirty seconds later the audience is sufficiently educated 
    and the guys begin to wail jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice thats monstermovie low 
    no reason no corners he shouts two minutes later theyre done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the new wave our next song is about 
    harlan ellison jake bellows and the geeks the hipsters the metalheads 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy 

    bldhag  note the dual umlauts  hails from seattle describing 
    themselves as educore the band performs nothing but twominute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers between songs the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books quizzes them on book titles and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards their motto the faster you go 
    deaf the more time you have to read
