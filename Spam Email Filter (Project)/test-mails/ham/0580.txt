 so eugen how many of your homo friends have had k lovers

el just one not everybody does that most of them are now dead anyway

point is youre not likely to extrapolate much  i could probably
find one hetero who had just as much sex   does that mean were all
rampant hos  no


 eegads if youre hypothesizing numbers like that eugen you at
 least owe it to fork to back that shit up

el aint done no hypothesizing anecdotal evidencerus couldnt you just
el google or something

listen  if you pull numbers like that without a fact the automagic
assumption is yes they were extracted out of your neither orifice
point wasnt to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits
its not my job to do your bit searching for you but i figured id
humor fork with this bit of finding

httpwwwthebodycombpaprresearchnotebookhtml  pointing ot
averages of about  for every  months for gay men which totals to
about   a year   a year doesnt equal    or even 


 just a quick assumption here   im not a math geek or anything but
 assuming  lover every day that would be like at least one lover
 everyday for  years and some change   i dont know about you but
 very very few of us are that lucky or even close to that lucky

el which was my point gurls dont do hyperpromiscuity as a life style its
el interesting that youre launching into a diatribe and threaten using
el instant argument just add hominem instead of assuming i might be not
el just pulling this whole thing out my nether orifice

wtf do my shitty math skillz have to do with girls and
hyperpromiscuity  i was speaking generally meaning that guys and
girls probably have better things to do than boink everything they
see  as above i am assuming youre pulling things out of your ass i
just felt like calling you on it

btw theres nothing wrong with calling someone on a silly idea  its
allowed and its generally not considered ad hominem but the
homophobia statement might be

 and after awhile even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle
 something new into their weekends   you really are assumiing that the
 homosexual population is a that large in a given area the meccas

el you ever been to san francisco

many times  which is why i said assuming that large  the meccas
dont count  sf is a mecca in this example  i obviously wasnt
clear tho one could assume i wasnt talking about medina



 a few nifty gaybars but thats a different story  b that boredsex
 obsessedrecreationally free to pursue sex that often with that many
 partners or that theyd even want that many partners

el this doesnt happen because it couldnt happen no one would want to 
el because you feel that way correct

doesnt happen  true   couldnt happen  who knows   it has nothing
to do with how i feel and everything to do with the fact that people
do concern themselves with more than just sex otherwise i think wed
see a helluva lot more of sex and a helluva lot less of everything
else


 qualify yourself or at least lower your outrageous numbers

el i didnt expect so much reflexive kneejerking on this list

well my suggestion is if you cant take the responses dont post
flamebait
