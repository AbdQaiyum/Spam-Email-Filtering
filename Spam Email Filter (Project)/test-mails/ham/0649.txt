the following prayer is from a story by mark twain and was quoted by lewis
laphan in the october issue of harpers magazine it occurs at the very end
of an excellent article which i recommend to you

in the story an old man enters a church where the congregation has been
listening to an heroic sermon about the glory to be won in battle by young
patriots armed with the love of god he usurps the pulpit and prays the
following

o lord our god help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our
shells help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their
patriot dead help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of
their wounded writhing in pain help us to lay waste their humble homes with
a hurricane of fire help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows
with unavailing grief help us to turn them out roofless with their little
children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and
hunger and thirst sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of
winter broken in spirit worn with travail imploring thee for the refuge of
the grave and denied it  for our sakes who adore thee lord blast their
hopes blight their lives protract their bitter pilgrimage make heavy their
steps water their way with their tears stain the white snow with the blood
of their wounded feet we ask it in the spirit of love of him who is the
source of love and who is the everfaithful refuge and friend of all that
are sore beset and seek his aid with humble and contrite hearts amen

twain wrote the story the war prayer in  during the american
occupation of the philippines but the story wasnt printed until 
thirteen years after his death because the editors thought it unsuitable
for publication at the time it was written
