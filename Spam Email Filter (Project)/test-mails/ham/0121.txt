hi all
im trying to set up the following

 a linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for lan connectivity
 other lan pcs with ethernet cards using the linux server for
dnsdhcp etc

basically i want to route any non lan traffic through the ppp

ive got some of the way but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems when i am connected to the internet with eht up the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp eh must be the
default route or something

is there standard out of the box linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the lan pcs   im planning on non routable
addresses xx for the lan routed outwards via the ppp
interface

can someone point me at the right howtos or routing documentation i need
to follow  
thanks
dermot
