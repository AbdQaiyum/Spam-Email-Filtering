it seems that something changed during the last  weeks

 in a folder msgs n is read ncurrent n upwards is unread
 change to another folder
 change back to the original folder and youll see msg n being 
highlighted as current for a split second that it changes back to 
ncurrent

kind of annoying since it marks msg n as read
