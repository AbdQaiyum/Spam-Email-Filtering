 ive never heard of any cdrom or dvdrom drive having problems with dma
 although there probably is since red hat decided to default disabling it a
 few releases back 

heh i get to see bad cdrom problems all the time mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save each but there are chipsets and
drives with known dma issues as well

 normally even if you try to enable dma and your device doesnt support it
 it simply dont be able to make the change and thats it the problem iirc
 is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support dma but doesnt work as
 expected when its enabled maybe chris could confirm this 

usually if you enable dma on a cdrom that cant handle it gracefully you
wont be able to read data off it relably and thats about it no
endoftheworld problems and easily fixed

 i guess ill settle for the devdvd link change as described and putting
 the dma tip in the description 

my biggest beef with automatically setting devdvd is that i always
seem to have a cdburner and a dvd drive or dvd burner in the same
box and i usually have the dvd as the second drive devcdrom in
kudzuspeak i agree that the description is the best place for the
tip unless someone can come up with a way to probe cddvd drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading idescsi or
having that media currently in the drive
