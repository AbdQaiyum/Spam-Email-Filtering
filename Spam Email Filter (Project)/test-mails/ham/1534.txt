kerry nice said

 what about some reality check rules  yeah you can pack in lots of things
 into the header to try and get some negative points but do they all make
 sense in combination  can you have a pine message id in the same header
 with an outlook express one or a mutt useragent

yes this is a big bonus of meta rules new in  we can now
eg check for an outlookstyle forwarded message and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
outlook

 i think the headers should be paid special attention to  the message
 content of something from the ny times or lockergnome might look spammy but
 usually they dont forge or fake anything in the header  tone down the
 negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries

when we get more good nice tests the ga will assign lower
scores to them  i think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase and lots
of ve tests that those newsletters hit giving the ga a big
problem to solve
