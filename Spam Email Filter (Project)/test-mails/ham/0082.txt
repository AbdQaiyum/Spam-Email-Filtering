thanks matthias  actually i got all four speakers with subwoofer
working in digital out mode with gamixer
httpwwwtcnetnejpfmuratalinuxdown

however switching between analog and digital im still baffled  as i
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to line in on a sblive 
which is in analog mode  but digital out works great now

  ok i got alsa installed and there is no static inbetween mps like
  before which is great  my setup is digital  but sound is only coming
  from front  speakers and subwoofer rear speakers there is no sound 
  also alsamixer or aumix are unresponsive as well 
 
 maybe you could find more info or tips on the alsa page for your card
 also you could try alsactl store editing etcasoundstate by hand
 for me it contains data similar to what i can control with alsamixer
 then run alsactl restore and see if youre able to change what you want
 that way
