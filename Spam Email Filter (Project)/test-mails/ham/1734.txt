 hi

hello

  snipped for brevity  

  this concept could also be
 applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions
 except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course

	although the data might just be the information that needs protecting

 does anyone do this already or is this a new concept

	ive seen this implemented for a shell server although they chose
to have their root on a cdwr in a cdr drive which meant that even
when compromised it was only possible to examine other users data
	afairemember they just swapped cds when a root exploit was found

 thanks for any opinions

np
