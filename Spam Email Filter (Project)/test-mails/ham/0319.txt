 the disappearing alliance
 by dale franks 

 obviously in such a
 political atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
 increase

given current trends particularly in demographics such conflict wont
be military  europe wouldnt stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry  they are sol

not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldnt stand united

 
 that thought is frightening enough even more frightening however is
the
 thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of
the
 new ideology of transnational progressivism

now that is a scary thought
