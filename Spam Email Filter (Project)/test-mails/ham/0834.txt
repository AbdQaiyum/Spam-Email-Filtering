o utensils of the world 

i wonder if it is possible to reverseengineer the reedsolomon 
errorcorrecting codes to create a bytestream such that when burned 
onto a cd you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern

i suppose this is a modern equivalent to lineprinter artwork i was 
imagining using a cdrw drive to use the outer track say to spell out 
the disc title creation time etc it would sure beat feeding cds 
through a laser printer
