 i envy some of those posting to this list  ive been in business for
  years and i havent yet had the luxury of writing every line of
 code for any project we are always coerced by budgets and time to
 maximize the amount of work done elsewhere  

for consultancy integration or open source work sure perl python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense imo

i should note that normally when ive used c or c in the past its
dictated by the fact that i would be working on a commercial product
written from the ground up where the code youre generating is important
ip for the company in this case using a thirdparty lib often is not an
option or would be a pita licensingwise

also cutting out thirdparty dependencies can reduce the risk of oops
there goes the company that makes that library i depend on now to shop
around for something vaguely similar figure out what bugs its got
rewrite my code to use the new api and hope for the best

this can be a very big deal for obvious reasons     open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using lgpld libs
