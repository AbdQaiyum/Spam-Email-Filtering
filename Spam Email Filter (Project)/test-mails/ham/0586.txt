here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes with 
no reference to sexual preference that i could find the point would seem to 
be that  sexual activity follows a power curve with a few people a la 
wilt chamberlain having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts 
ev en in a short period of time and  a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women  i have no idea being a statistical ignoramus whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sexpartnersdistribution curve means that youd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men

for example the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women 
is approximately  and in a sample of less than  swedish women we find an 
individual with  partners for men the mean is approximately  and we 
find an individual with  partners which is almost  times larger than 
the mean so somehow don juan was not such an extraordinary case but just 
one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed 


as for gay men there is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men you can read about it in randy schiltzs and the 
band played on he writes about  bathhouse culture prehiv he also discusses 
how in the gay politics of the time there was a subculture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued and acted on the argument that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was it was an 
explicitly political statement monogamy is an artifact of straight culture
    that view seems to have died in more ways than one part of the point of 
schiltzs book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the aids epidemic that eventually killed schiltz among so many 
others this doesnt let eugen off the hookbut it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community
