ah  neither ted nor i were particularly up to date  i pulled 
down the lates from cvs and am now running with it  i miss the 
blue ftoc lines but ill sort that out soon iirc chris said 
its a simple resource change

teds code to ketchup made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization  ive fixed it up almost 
and it looks like this now

proc cabeenmarkcurseen  
    global exmh mhprofile msg
    set results 
    exmhstatus clearing unseen up to cur red
    mhsetcur exmhfolder msgid
    set unseen mhsequence exmhfolder mhprofileunseensequence 
    foreach elem unseen 
         if  elem  msgid  
            lappend results elem
         
    
    busy seqdel exmhfolder mhprofileunseensequence results
    exmhstatus ok blue



the almost is because its not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc  im too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff  if someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free

now that ive got all of chris sequence stuff i discovered that 
my sequences are  cluttered
