 scissors  

i like most other people here went through the security checkpoint unlike 
everyone else they decided to search my suitcase the security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out clothing umbrellas a jacket and a 
box of crackers she searched all the pockets nothing apparently the jacket 
was suspicious she sent it through again nothing 

    the lady in the next lane waved a inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on i can only assume she answered yes 

she put everything back in and sent it through again still suspicious they 
took everything out it looked like this was going to take a while so i used 
the opportunity to put the tickets i was holding back in my bag when i looked 
back up the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying this cant 
go on board i dont remember packing that i said i let her confiscate it 

i called my mom she doesnt remember packing it either is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocentlooking peoples suitcases i 
cant see why this would be useful how would they know what plane im on once 
im on the plane how would they get the scissors they could threaten me but 
if they have a threatening implement already then why do they need the 
scissors perhaps its some sort of matroishcadoll system they use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of a new kind of science 
they use anks to bludgeon a th grader into giving them a wedge block and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors those are some pretty clever 
terrorists 

update false alarm my mom called apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night it must have fallen in the 
nation can go back to yellow level terrorist alert  

 waiting for wireless  

now i am at ohare airport sitting outside the admirals club while 
businessmen walk in and out i am looking for a wireless signal the signal i 
used last time i was here but not finding it of course last time i was here 
i had an admirals club card this time i have a mileage plus card but despite 
the airline ologopolyor perhaps because of it have to keep up appearances 
you knowi doubt they will accept it 

 irony  

according to the announcement i just heard mr valenti is going to miss his 
flight 

i think of what id say if i ran into him jack id exclaim as if we were 
old pals going to the eldred case of course he was going to be a good 
one hey remember when you had that debate with lessig id ask you said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
internet what ever happened to that i imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch his plane is going to leave soon he has to run 

another announcement mr michael mckenna needs to call his office good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date 

 automatic flush toilets  

now i am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances in 
the first at my old high school where you think some people might be a little 
short the flush went off once accidentally ok i thought i can handle 
one mistake then it went off again here at the airport it misfired three 
times 

this is annoying and inexcusable have they not heard of user testing do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms this problem must be remedied 
immediately i recommend releasing a service pack on the manufacturers web 
site 

 arrival  

ive arrived in dconce again im sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someones connection trip was very smooth had lunch with 
lisa and went to the spy museum pretty cool but could have been better now
