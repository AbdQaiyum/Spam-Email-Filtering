    e saturation  let me ask youif you were on a rock in the
    e middle of the atlantic mostly in the dark for half the year
    e wouldnt you like a bit of internet distraction  theyve
    e already done the obvious and fiberringed the island

theres lots of similar places  saskatchewan for example once
shared with iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
iceland sask is a landlocked massive expanse of ultraflat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundredthousandhectares

its still curious iceland leads  maybe theres just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world maybe theyre downloading bjork videos
