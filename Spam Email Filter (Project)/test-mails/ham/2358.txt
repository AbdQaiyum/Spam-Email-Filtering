a san francisco cabbie  generally a welleducated and firmopinionholding 
class of person  has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
noncarowning heart why is it so damned hard to get a cab in san francisco 


    in fact no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone when you 
    phone a cab firm in san francisco your call is treated not as an order 
    not as a binding oral contract but simply as a request 

    so why dont cab companies ensure that we pick you up on timeor at all 
    in a nutshell labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action that constitutes an 
    employeremployee relationship but if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes it also means that the contractor 
    drivers cant unionize
