remember i didnt say it was necessarily a good source just that it
looked good

the site was httpwwwreligioustoleranceorgchrchtm

my memory of what they said was accurate  i do not have the competence
to defend what they said  james taubers response indicates a breadth
of knowledge i cant match

  ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of
the
  ten commandments  it seems some of those meanings have evolved a
bit
  too
 
 by meanings have evolved do you or they mean that the hebrew words
 have changed meaning or that our understanding of the hebrew words
have
 changed or do they posit a premosaic form of the laws that had
 evolved by time of the pentateuch
 
  in particular there was a claim that the commandment on stealing
was
  actually specifically about man stealing  selling a free man into
  slavery
 
 this seems bogus to me a quick check of the text indicates the the
 hebrew word in question is ganav which elsewhere in the pentateuch eg
 gen  is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things
 
 in july  i made the following comment in response to a similar
 claim about the real meaning of one of the ten commandments
 
 
  the translations since cause problems at each successive remove
 
 we have the original language versions though so this is not an
 issue
 
  im sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the
meaning of
 the commandment
  is thou shalt not murder rather than kill
 
 this has nothing to do with successive translations it is based on
our
 knowledge of the meaning of the hebrew word ratsach most modern
 translations ive seen translate it murder but elsewhere the word is
 used
 of an animal killing a human something for which most english
speakers
 wouldnt use the word murder
