   i faced a similar problem with the freebsd when trying to 
  install spamassassin through the ports on my fresh freebsd  
  i had to define perllib with some given order of directories
  so that the latest filespec module get used 
 
 good to hear its not just me  mind telling me how you set perllib
 specificly ive tried a few things setenv in the shell as well as
 perllib  inside the makefilepl even on the perl command
 line with no success
 
 presuming your run bash  
note the directory lists 
  perl e map  print n  inc
then set up the shell variable perllib variable and put it in some bashrc 
for future use
 export perllibdirectorydirectorydirectorydirectory
then try to install the software

perllib is explained perlrun  do 
 man perlrun for more information
