once upon a time joshua wrote 

 just a thought would it be possible to generalize this alsa 
 stuff to make building a kernel with any customoptionalupdated
 modules an easy thing i think some scripts or at least stepbystep
 instructions would be great 
 
 for example to build a kernel rpm with alsa do
  get the kernel source
  get the alsa source
  run the customkernelsh script
 
 
 or a kernel rpm with the lastest wireless lan drivers
  get the kernel source
  get the cvs driver source
  run the customkernelsh script
 
 
 etc

this wouldnt be worth the effort involved imho and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested
your first example is a good one because i really think its even easier
currently 
 leave your current kernel asis
 get the alsadriver source rpm
 rebuild and install resulting packages

drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules like ltmodem
nvidia alsa etc can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm

also what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind i see it more as a one size fits all achievement in the general
case and kernel isnt an exception although there are packages optimized
for various processors since they all come with just about all the modules
youll ever need make that one size fits many then if you want 

last but not least  the kernel is something im trying to keep away from
in my packaging since i really dont want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website same goes for gnome kde and
other major bits of the distribution since i also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next red hat linux release
without having their system turned into another ximian mess

ps yes chris im worried about not giving you too much work less in fact
since you can easily answer freshrpmsnet to people asking how to play
dvds right
