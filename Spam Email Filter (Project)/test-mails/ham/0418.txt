    j you open sourced the new components you developed for this
    j project so the next person who comes along wont have to
    j reimplement them right

no need all those components already exist either in the java
class libraries or from the various java jar collections  most
of the classes i used came from the jakarta project and apachexml

but if its any consolation my threading of them all together into
a newswire server is gpl and available on sourceforge
