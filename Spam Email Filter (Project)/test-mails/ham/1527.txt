 this was thoroughly confusing but by playing musical chairs with the spamd
 args i smashed a bug
 
 ok
 spamd debug daemonize autowhitelist usernamenobody allowedips
 
 ok
 spamd debug daemonize autowhitelist usernamenobody allowedips
  
 not ok
 spamd debug daemonize autowhitelist usernamenobody allowedips
  

fwiw i cant reproduce this with

  spamd debug autowhitelist allowedips
  spamd debug autowhitelist allowedips 
  spamd debug autowhitelist allowedips 

which i presume is what you meant except for the missing args
of course  they all seem to work ok
