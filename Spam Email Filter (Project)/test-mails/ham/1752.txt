  whats an autoham
 
 automatically marking something as ham after a given
 timeout regardless of how long that timeout is someone is going
 to forget to submit the message back as spam

ok heres a refinement  assuming very little spam comes through we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam  the program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved nonspam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection  you could do this once a day or week config
parameter

 how many spamsashams can be accepted before the fn rate gets
 unacceptable

config parameter

 i view imap as a stopgap measure until tighter integration with
 various email clients can be achieved
 
 i still feel its better to require classification feedback from the
 recipient rather than make any assumptions after some period of
 time passes but this is an enduser issue and were still at the
 algorithm stage 

im trying to think about the enduser issues because i have nothing
to contribute to the algorithm at this point  for deployment we need
both
