david asked
 my wife noticed something odd  the nearlyfull moon was about 
 degrees above the horizon  there was a notable glow on the horizon
 except under the moon  the moon seemed to be in a column of darkness
 that was about three times the apparent width of the moon  we could see
 the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky
 around it

 any of you ever see this  do you have any idea what could have caused
 it  i suspect its due to some pecularity of the visual system but
 have no clear idea

im surprised to not find this phenomenon in corlis i could have sworn i
saw it there he does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow i personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semicircle of darker sky

i know ive read about pillars under the sun and moon elsewhere but i cant
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright i do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system im
sorry i havent got any answers but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up
