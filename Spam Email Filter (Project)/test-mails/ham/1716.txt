 ive been testing razor invoked from sendmailprocmail and so far it
 seems pretty copacetic last nights spam to the list provided a good test
  the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged as
 other list members reported
 
 this morning i piped the messages out from pine being careful to use the
 raw mode to razorcheck d none of the messages come back as spam even
 the spam since folks revoked the false positives i understand why they
 would not come up but not the spam itself unless that also was revoked
 
 is this spam just a bad one to test against or is there some setting in
 pine or razor that i am missing

    are you using spamassassin on the input side  ive just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the proper way to pass it through there systemwide before accepting it and sending it to the users  its kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user when the users home directories are nfs mountedand the source is on my own machine on which i try new things and its the only machine with the drivespace
