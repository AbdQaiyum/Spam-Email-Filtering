      this paste function can be convenient but it turns out that
      users still need to keep track of the difference between the
      two selections  if a user only understands the clipboard
      then the user of primary is only surprising  i learned that
      it is best to have a separate paste user action for the two
      selections  the convention is that buttonrelease sets
      the insert point and inserts the primary selection  the
      paste event eg the paste key simply inserts the
      clipboard selection at the current insert point 

yeah i learned by hearing exmh users scream in agony  sorry about
all that  we should be able to clean this up  if you grep for
bind in seditbind you quickly find the textselection proc
i described in the previous email
