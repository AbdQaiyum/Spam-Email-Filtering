anyone have a copy of bell centennial i can borrow i wonder if ill ever have 
 to spend on fonts matthew carter id be happy to pay you the two cents 
in royalties you probably get for selling  worth of fonts

than i can list here points out that gill sans which i was asking for earlier 
is included with os x i knew mac os x included a lot of great fonts but 
i dont know how i overlooked this awesome
