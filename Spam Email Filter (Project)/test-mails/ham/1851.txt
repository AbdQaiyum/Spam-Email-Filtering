 i never used configparser before but i read that its read 
 method silently ignores files that dont exist  if bayesini
 isnt found none of the options will be defined 

note that i since got rid of bayesini its embedded in optionspy 
now so searchpath issues wont burn you here anymore  the intended 
way to customize the tokenizer and testers is via creating your own 
bayescustomizeini  youll get burned by searchpath issues wrt that 
instead now  wink
