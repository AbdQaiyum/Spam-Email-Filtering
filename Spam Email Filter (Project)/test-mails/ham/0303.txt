 the help that i received today  then though i tried to build them  i
 started by trying the w program  i used the following lines which produced
 some strange results  would any one be able to set me straight
 
 configure withemacs prefixusrlocalsrcbetaw execprefixusr
 localsrcbetaw withurlurlurl
one thing i think you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes  prefix is the directory to be used as root
for installing files  typically packages use usrlocal as default
so binaries might then go in usrlocalbin documentation in
usrlocaldoc and so forth
normally i find it sufficient to put prefixusrlocal and do not
further specify things like execprefix

maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose in
which case ignore me
 that worked fine so i moved to the next step
 make
 at the bottem of the text i got the following messages
 cannot open load file urlurlurlvarsel
 make  customloadel error 
 make leaving directory usrlocalsrcbetawlisp
 make  w error 
 
 when i got around to trying the url package i had no problems  in saying
 that this doesnt necessarily mean that i was doing it right so below are
 the commands i used
 configure withemacs prefixurlurl execprefixurlurl
id make the same remarks about prefixes here  i would use the command
    configure withemacs prefixusrlocal

to get w to compile i think the withurl flag you should use is
    withurlusrlocalshareemacssitelisp
assuming you compiledinstalled url with prefixusrlocal
since you appear to have installed url in urlurl configure w with
configure withemacs prefixusrlocal withurlurlurlshareemacssitelisp

a command you would have found useful would have been
    find  name urlvarsel print
which would have told you where the urlvarsel file was installed

a program which is very useful is checkinstall
httpasiclinuxcommxiztocheckinstall
it allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro rpmdebtgz
instead of make install type checkinstall and a package is put
together and installed for you  makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be
