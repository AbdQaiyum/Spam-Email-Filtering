i suspect that as part of chris set of changes he cleaned up the
use of the variable that was named l in ftoccommit in ftoctcl
its name got changed from l to lineno

but theres one reference of l left   that causes tracebacks if
you attempt to use link with the current cvs version of exmh

i guess that most of us dont use link very often  i noticed it
last week but only got time to look and see why today

if someone with the ability to commit to the cvs repository would
apply the following patch to libftoctcl that would be nice
it works and is trivial and you could perhaps just apply it by
making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and
applying it  theres only one instance of l in the file that
should be changed to lineno
