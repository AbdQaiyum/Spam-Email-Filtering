 id prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried
 that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora

your corpora are biased in this respect though  newsgroups have a
strong social taboo on posting html but in many peoples personal
inboxes it is quite abundant

getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i
though  my own saved mail doesnt reflect what i receive since i
save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past 

    multipartmixed
        textplain        brief text plus urls
        texthtml         long html copied from website
 
 ah  that explains why the html tags didnt get stripped  id again
 offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that theyd get
 stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that
 would feel too much like a loss wink

ill bite  sounds like a good idea to strip the html in this case
id like to see how this improves the fp rate on this corpus
